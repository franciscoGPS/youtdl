This kind of music, use it, and you get amped to do shit
Whenever you hear some shit and you can't refuse it
It's just some shit, for these kids, to trash they rooms with
Just refuse whenever they asked to do shit
The type of shit that you don't have to ask who produced it
You just know - that's the new shit
The type of shit that causes mass confusion
And drastic movement of people acting stupid

(Verse 1: Kon Artis)
I come to every club with intention to do harm
With a prosthetic arm and smelling like Boone's Farm
Hiding under tables as soon as I hear alarms
Paranoid thief that'll steal from his own mom
Kuniving Kon, artist with a bomb
Strapped to my stomach screaming, ""Let's get it on!""
A lush that love to drink, drunk driving a tank
Rollin' over a bank, cops see me and faint
It's drastic, I'm past my limit of coke
I think I'll up my high by slitting your throat
Push your baby carriage into the street, till it's mince meat
Your mens been beat the minute I step onto your street
This is fight music!

(Verse 2: Bizarre)
You know why my hands are so numb? (No)
Cause my grandmother sucked my dick and I didn't cum (oh)
Smacked this whore for talking crap (bitch)
So what if she's handicapped, the bitch said Bizarre couldn't rap!
I fucking hate you; I'll take your drawers down and rape you
While Dr. Dre videotapes you (hell yeah!)
Satan done got me on this song
Eating a hot dog reading the Holy Qu'ran, while I'm on the john
Tired of wearing this yellow thong
Take it back Sisqo, you know where it belongs (thong th-thong thong)
Now here's a gun, I'll put it in your palm
Now go over there and blow up Dru Hill's arms
Fuck your love songs!

(Verse 3: Proof)
Just bring who you gon' bring on, who you gon' swing on?
I'm King Kong, guns blow you to kingdom come
Show you machine gun funk
Sixteen m-16's and one pump
The snub in my paw, shove it in your jaws
Have you running out this fucking club in your drawers
We loving the broads, there's nothing to applaud
But fuck it it's all good, the hood is up in us all
It's fight music!

(Verse 4: Swifty McVay)
I'm a nigga that loves scuffles
And won't hesitate to sock you again for swollen knuckles
I'm like that, catch a nigga like bear traps
Blow his head back right in front of the precinct (YOU HEAR THAT!)
I slap your freak, bump you and won't speak
If you step on my feet, you get drowned in your own drink
I suffocated my shrink just for talking
Came back and fucked up his pallbearers and made them drop his coffin
It's fight music!

(Verse 5: Kuniva)
These beads I'm swinging is stinging them
See all these niggas? When I step in the club, I'm bringing them
If any nigga looking too hard, we Rodney King'n them
Malice green to them and gasolining them with premium
Light a cigarette, flick it at them or spit it at them
Hold up a picture of his family and kick it at him (no!)
Blast while you right hooking, right when your wife's looking
Fuck fight music, bitch, this is losing your life music!

(Verse 6: Eminem)
If I could capture the rage of today's youth and bottle it
Crush the glass from my bare hands and swallow it!
And spit it back in the faces of you racists
And hypocrites who think the same shit but don't say shit!
You Liberace's, Versace's, and you Nazis
Watch me, cause you figured you got me in this hot seat!
You motherfuckers wanna JUDGE me 'cause you're NOT me!
You'll never STOP me, I'm TOP speed as you POP me!
I came to save these new generations of babies!
From parents who failed to raise them 'cause they're lazy!
To grow to praise me I'm making them go crazy!
That's how I got this whole nation to embrace me!
And you fugazi if you think I'mma admit wrong!

Everybody wanna hide from the gun, from the gun
You can take a ride through this life, if you want
But you can't take that edge off that knife, no, sir

And now you want your money back, money back
But you're denied 'cause your brains fried from the sack
And there ain't nothing I can do
'Cause life is a lesson; you learn it when you're through

Everybody  (everybody), come take my hand  (come take my hand) 
We'll walk this road together  through the storm
Whatever weather  cold or warm 
Just lettin' you know that, you're not alone 
Holla if you feel like  you've been down the same road

You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper, before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words, before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'ma do somethin' I do it, I don't give a damn

What you think, I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world feed it beans
It's gassed up, if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who looked down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony

No if ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From  down to the last  album, he's still shittin'
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him

Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a ""fuck you"" for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the earth, he's got the urge
To pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole universe

I'm not afraid  to take a stand 
Everybody , come take my hand 
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

OK quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm, for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth, for that
Fuck your feelin's, instead of gettin' crowned you're gettin' capped

And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact
Let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was eh
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground

Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack-bloww
'Cause I ain't playin' around, there's a game called circle
And I don't know how, I'm way too up to back down

But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud
Still follows me around, but it's time to exorcise these demons
These motherfuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now

I'm not afraid  to take a stand 
Everybody , come take my hand 
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like, you've been down the same road

And I just can't keep livin' this way
So startin' today, I'm breakin' out of this cage
I'm standin' up, I'ma face my demons
I'm mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, believe me you

I been through the ringer, but they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead, no more beef flingers

No more drama from now on, I promise
To focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof, like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it

'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
'Cause I'm raisin' the bar, I shoot for the moon
But I'm too busy gazin' at stars, I feel amazin' and I'm not

I'm not afraid  to take a stand 
Everybody , come take my hand 
We'll walk this road together, through the storm

The blackest soul inside of me
One foot stuck in the past
One planted in my grave

Running circles, old habits die hard

Call me reckless, call me stuck in my ways
I'm torn between the remedies for everything

Dry mouth, taste it like a cut vein
Blackout, it all ends the same

So stay away, stay away
Can you tell when I lie right through my teeth?

Like a chain, in a way we are all bound to our fate

Don't let it bury me

With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal
I am phenomenal
However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I would never say, 'Oh, it's impossible'
'Cause I'm born to be phenomenal

Unstoppable, unpoppable thought bubbles
Untoppable thoughts, fuckin' juggernaut that'll
Stomp you in the verse, obstacles I'm drawn to 'em
When the going got rough
Some of what I done fought through was the worst, little sissy
Who the fuck taught you how to persevere?
There ain't no situation that you ever had to respond to that's adverse
The messiest thing you've ever gone through was your purse
Yeah, I don't try like hell, then I might as well
Hang it up like a shelf, gotta keep growin' with it, evolve
'Cause you can keep throwin' shit at the wall
But you're gonna find that nothing's gonna stick until you apply yourself
Time to slip in that zone till I find myself
Inside the realm of the unknown and boldly go
Into waters where nobody else has gone before
Or willing to go, uncharted, feeling is so
Bomb, I'm feelin' myself, I'm a giant
Sometimes I gotta remind myself that I am...

I am phenomenal

With every breath in my lungs

Let me self-empower you
When you're down and they're tryin' to clown the fuck out of you
And you feel like you're runnin' out of fuel
I'll show you how to use doubt as fuel
Convert it to gunpowder too
Now what you do is put the match to the charcoal fluid
Put the spark to it like Martha Stewart barbecuing
Ah screw it, feel like you want to hit that wall then do it
Punch through it, just cock back, put your all into it
Now you gon' take that rage and make that what you wage
Never take back what you say
If you stay strapped in your brain, engaged in a steel cage match
Ready to scrap asap
Take your fists and just ball it
Show who's big and who's smallest you're Christopher Wallace
Now picture 'em all as plastic and foam
Lays flat, where you put your dinner plates at
And set it on 'em like a placemat
(I am phenomenal)
And I want you to say that

I am phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs

It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I would never say, 'Oh, it's impossible'
'Cause I'm born to be phenomenal

Step into the unknown and find yourself
You're floating freely, no emotion

Got a fuckin' mouth with no shut-off valve
Can't even cut off power to it, but it's what allowed
Me to come up out from under the fuckin' ground
'Cause I worked my butt off now
It's a subject that I don't know how to shut up about
'Cause I stuck it out
Like a motherfucking tongue that's how, I responded when I got shoved around
You're gonna have non-believers
But when you're beyond belief, you probably shouldn't wonder how
Get it how you live
But are you prepared to give more than you get?
And put in twice what you get back from this shit
Though what you sacrifice barely is half, never give
Rap is my shiv
But it's like my shield at the same time I wield and my knife is will
Sometimes I feel just like B. Real from Cypress Hill
How I can just kill a cypher, survivor's guilt
I rhyme like life is still an uphill climb
Ready to face any challenge, waitin'
Can taste it, it's salivation, I'm wagin' retaliation
Look what I have built, reputation is validation
The only thing I'm capable of makin' is amazing
Only thing you're capable of makin' is a false statement
Or accusation... I am legendary status, in fact
That is the only way you'll ever be able to say
Your legend is makin' an allegation
I write with the left, same hand I hold the mic with
As I fight to the death, till my last breath
Managed to prove who the best man is
Prevail at all costs, be the only ones left standing
In the end, but I ain't gonna be the only one with the advantage
Of knowing what it's like to be southpaw
'Cause you can bet your ass you'll be left handed
'Cause I am

Man I promise, she's so self-conscious
She has no idea what she's doing in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecure
The concept of school seems so secure
Sophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a career
She like, ""Fuck it, I'll just stay down here and do hair""
'Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs
'Cause her baby-daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off, now she look like Eve
And she be dealin' with some issues that you can't believe

It seems we living the American dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us
We trying to buy back our forty acres
And for that paper, look how low we a stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe

'Cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth

Steada kisses, we get kicked

From standin' on the corners boppin'

To drivin' some of the hottest cars, New York has ever seen

For droppin' some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard

From the dope spot, with the smoke glock

Fleein' the murder scene, you know me well

From nightmares of a lonely cell, my only hell

But since when y'all niggaz know me to fail? Fuck naw

Where all my niggaz with the rubber grips, bust shots?

And if you with me, mom, I rub on your tits, and what not



I'm from the school of the hard knocks, we must not

Let outsiders violate our blocks, and my plot

Let's stick up the world and split it fifty-fifty

Let's take the dough and stay real jiggy

And sip the cris' and get pissy pissy

Flow infinitely like the memory of my nigga biggie, baby

You know it's hell when I come through

Locked down in the ten by fo', controllin' the house

We live in hard knocks, we don't take over we borrow blocks

Burn 'em down and you can have it back, daddy, I'd rather that

I flow for chicks wishin', they ain't have to strip to pay tuition

I see you vision mama, I put my money on the longshots

All my ballers that's born to clock

Now I'ma be on top whether I perform or not



I went from lukewarm to hot, sleepin' on futons and cots

To king size dream machines, the green fives

I've seen pies let the thing between my eyes analyze life's ills

Then I put it down type braille

I'm tight grill with the phony, rappers y'all might feel we homies

I'm like still, y'all don't know me, shit

I'm tight grill when my situation ain't improvin'

Hustling's still inside of me, and as far as progress

You'd be hard-pressed, to find another rapper hot as me

Walking up on the stage for Beyonce

That you're not a real artist, but it's my obligation

Honest Abe is on his way, you will not escape

Ammunition replenish the Punisher

With his gun ensure hundred words

And a clip, in other words motherfuckers better run

And jump in front of a fuckin' runaway locomotive

Or get thrown up under it just tryna fuck with the.

I'll kneel to her, best believe make a meal of her...

Thank you



(Yes, yes, brilliant)



Told the preacher I love her, he said that God was a lover

I said he really loves her then he would love that we're lovers

I walk around in a bubble, a fucking scoundrel in trouble

In every town, make a rumble, the venue ground into rubble

Give me a ten, and I'll double, I'll split your face like some aces

I got a fragrance I'm wearing called, ""I will shit on you basics.""

The money wants me to have it, I have a hunger for data

I'm crunching numbers and crack unbreakable safes while I'm at it

I'm doing more than just rapping you have to grant me that dap

When you around where I'm at just know that it is not where you at

I'm not on your map, I'm a mystery to you captains of industry

If the 'matic is missing me automatic, it's victory

Hey!

Looking at the money like it's mine to get

I'm the shit bitch

We the grimy and gritty, made it the Grammy committees

Got told that we spit it too vicious and would never see victory

And I refuse to play humble as though my dick itty bitty

I got banana dick, your bitch go apeshit if she hit it

Meanwhile, you're too nervous, pervis, that's why you never get service

And me, I caught the preacher's wife workin' 'fore Sunday service

I put my hand up her skirt and then we prayed for purpose

I baptized her in Jesus name, left her shakin' and squirtin'

Ooh, I shocked the Sunday school and did that shit there on purpose

See, I'm a pervert with purpose that make you question your purpose

Run the Jewels'll arrive at arenas, bunch of blood thirsty hyenas

To get revenge on the kingdoms that killed the dreams of the dreamers

Drank alcohol for the demons, sip lean with all of the schemers

You see he groove with the people, move with the mind of a genius

You see, he workin' the angles so he ain't never an angel

They wanna get you to hang him, well give them fuckers a finger

Welcome to fuckyoupalooze, we bruisin' any who movin'

Who wanna stan' for these douches, you raise a hand and you lose it

I hold the door for old ladies, run into fires and save babies

I went to school in the eighties, taking the train with the crazies

New York, New York is the mothership where I used to smoke dust and shit

Now, I'm crop dustin' fuckers, suck it up and you'll love the shit

No more games, I'm above the shit, butter me up for nothing

I'm taking all of your ducats 'cause I can call when you're bluffing



Who thought the son of Denise would be the leader of people?

When he was your house at Morehouse, slangin' pounds of the reefer

Sat with potential presidents and said the p should be as legal as reparations

For what this nation has done to my people

I'm a pervert, a poet, I ain't a saint, and I know it

Been a crook and cooked the books but never shorted no whores

Promoters comp me the Moet, I'm the man and I know it

Burn your apartment with your family tied to the couch
And slit your throat, so when you scream, only blood comes out
I doubt that there could ever be... a more wicked MC
'Cause AIDS infested child molesters aren't sicker than me
I see the world for what it is, beyond the white and the black
The way the government downplays historical facts
'Cause the United States sponsored the rise of the 3rd Reich
Just like the CIA trained terrorists to the fight
Build bombs and sneak box cutters onto a flight
When I was a child, the Devil himself bought me a mic
But I refused the offer, 'cause God sent me to strike
With skills unused like fallopian tubes on a dyke
My words'll expose George Bush and Bin Laden
As two separate parts of the same seven headed dragon
And you can't fathom the truth, so you don't hear me
You think Illuminati's just a fuckin' conspiracy theory?

They gave Al Queda 6 billion dollars in 1989 to 1992
And now the last chapters of Revelations are coming true
And I know a lot of people find it hard to swallow this
Because subliminal bigotry makes you hate my politics

But you act like America wouldn't destroy two buildings
In a country that was sponsoring bombs dropped on our children
I was watching the Towers, and though I wasn't the closest
I saw them crumble to the Earth like they was full of explosives
And they thought nobody noticed the news report that they did
About the bombs planted on the George Washington bridge
Four Non-Arabs arrested during the emergency
And then it disappeared from the news permanently
They dubbed a tape of Osama, and they said it was proof
""Jealous of our freedom,"" I can't believe you bought that excuse
Rockin' a motherfucking flag don't make you a hero

And just so Conservatives don't take it to heart
I don't think Bush did it, 'cause he isn't that smart
He's just a stupid puppet taking orders on his cell phone
From the same people that sabotaged Senator Wellstone
The military industry got it poppin' and lockin'
Looking for a way to justify the Wolfowitz Doctrine
And as a matter of fact, Rumsfeld, now that I think back
Without 9/11, you couldn't have a war in Iraq
Or a Defense budget of world conquest proportions
Kill freedom of speech and revoke the right to abortions
Tax cut extortion, a blessing to the wealthy and wicked
But you still have to answer to the Armageddon you scripted
And Dick Cheney, you fuckin' leech, tell them your plans
About building your pipelines through Afghanistan
And how Israeli troops trained the Taliban in Pakistan
You might have some house niggaz fooled, but I understand
Colonialism is sponsored by corporations
That's why Halliburton gets paid to rebuild nations
Tell me the truth, I don't scare into paralysis

Who wished and wished till it came true,
And now this kid can fly

I got an idea for a movie,
And here's my pitch
I get a job and quit my band,
And you stop being a bitch

And we will have adventures,

Is it too soon to whisper Oscar?

Put a happy ending there and it'll write itself, I swear
All we need, all we need are some meetings and a lead
With a happy ending there this thing will write itself, I swear
All we need, all we need is some trick photography

I forgot one thing about the guy
Who gained the ability to fly
It was actually only for a foot or two
And only an inch or so high.

And we will have adventures,

Went the distance, now I'm not going to stop

I've been here for years
I'm rockin my peers
Puttin suckers in fear
Makin the tears rain down like a monsoon
Listen to the bass go boom
Explosions
Overpowerin
Over the competition I'm towerin
Records shock
When I drop these lyrics that'll make you call the cops
Don't you dare stare
You better move
Don't ever compare
Me to the rest that'll all get sliced and diced
Competition's payin the price

I'm gonna rock this land
I'm gonna take this itty-bitty world by storm
And I'm just gettin warm
Just like Mohammad Ali - they called him Cassius
Watch me bash this beat like a skull
Dont'cha know I had beef with
Why don't you riff with me?
The maniac psycho
And when I pull out my jammy, get ready, 'cause it might go blauh!
How ya like me now?
The ripper will not allow
You to get with Mr. Smith
Don't risk
Listen to my gear shift
I'm blastin
Outlastin
Kinda like Shaft
So you could say I'm Shaftin
Old English filled my mind
And I came up with a funky rhyme

For the [?] caring flaring with the tools

I'm the hardest spitter and I got the heart to kill you

I put your squad up in the grave then I party with you

You not soldiers you stock brokers, the Glock's smoking

I'm Pac over Nas I'm a start rock and rolling

I'm Michelangelo eating you like a cannibal

Greeting you with my hammer-lo

Deepest flow I'm mechanical

Mandible like Canibus

Render these rappers like amateurs

Panicking what she should be my uzi weighing a ton or two

I got determination, that's right the term is waiting

To turn your safe into my personal bank and burn your paper

The MC slaughterer, pardon us we make horror flicks

We chopping bodies like calamari, you pounds of fish

On a scale lucky lefty

Sonnie turn your vessy messy

Grabbing you by the neck, sticking the knife inside

Then he told me about the Oracle of Amon
He gave me no clue where it is
Men feared time, yet time fear the pyramids
He gave me more jewels, he told me that
Amenhotep was immortal, I can't overstand hieroglyph
So I called Killah Priest, and he taught me how to follow it
I walked through the Valley of the Kings
With a white robe, white rose and what I will brings
And your whole team Judas, my road thin, gold skin like Zeus's
I speak the dialog of the dead, I practiced the same war tactics
In King Arthur's head, so let the swordsmen kill the beast

Build from the mind of rhyme, rolls off the tongue like fine rugs
Let me walk you through this, for the clueless
I'm Shakespeare'ing, with grey earrings
Speak like Tiberius, write novels
Spit it like Aristotle, face half Pharaoh
And half owl, I took the path of Cairo
Came back with the Dead Sea Gospel
Now I'm known as the Dead Street Apostle
See dem feds, shoot them hollows
Bullets spread, till they meet Diablo
Stars in alignment, Priest meet with Jedi Mind Tricks
Reach them climates, where you can't breathe
Stay high off that dead weed, in the mind is where I plant seeds
To grow fruit, of kings so brute, of army troops
Mighty men in celestial suits
You need healing, my mic give you incredible boost
Where I use satellite vision, stare at my alphabetical soup
Plus I use the Big Dipper to take, more than one scoop, it's Priesthood

You don't wanna see, desert eag' heat pop you

Hey yo Jimmy caught a bad one, Jimmy is a cripple

In a wheelchair got the skinniest pitbull

Sally Braun bitch big Indian nipples

The only one who really understood what he went through

That one night caught up in the middle of a gun fight

Shot in the back, blacked out when the sunlight came

He woke up in the hospital numb

With no memories of ambulances, coppers that come

Only memories of how he used to walk and he'd run

Now he's fucked, fucked up feeling awkward and dumb

With his legs on the floor, they're useless

Pain killers chewed in his tooth talking to the nurse holler

Shooting ruined his life, maneuvers and stuff

Needs help putting on his pants, shoes and it sucks

Fuck, when they fight it should produce you to duck

It's an unfair life, this is Lucifer's luck

Is this world fucked up? Is it gruesome enough?

You caught a bad one, son. This is Lucifer's luck

When it wasn't your fault call it Lucifer's luck

Shit is ruthless, it's ruthless, it's Lucifer's luck



[Verse 2:]

It was crazy how Roberto and Sadie

They both a product of the eighties

Had a premature baby and named her Haley

Little lady, three pounds in an incubator

Who knew the depths of parents would sink to later?

Illegal aliens, both barely in the country

Got an application for citizenship but didn't mail it in

Sadie got a job at the strip club, no frills

Roberto's now a stay-at-home mom with no skills

When Haley's hungry she screams he can't take em

Squeezing on her feeble little bones, he might break em

He fractures and cracks 'em in a demonic fashion

Leaving no bruises, nobody questions or asks him

And the baby just suffers enough to get

Her precious life snuffed and her little body stuffed in a trunk

Hidden deep in a storage unit, both parents burn in hell

That's how Lucifer planned to do it



[Repeat Chorus:]



[Verse 3:]

She couldn't explain why daddy couldn't refrain

From touching her eighty pound frame

He gonna lay the ground game

She got blood in her panties, that ain't a shit stain

By an ordained minister who's so sinister

When the band shake, her little body shake

She close her eyes, escape the rape

He used your strength paint a picture of a saint

In a small, quiet town that's really so quaint

In Delaware it's hell in here, the minister millionaire

Wife know to act unaware

Why his sick-ass sniffing her little underwear

It's no fun in here when you're young and full of fear

Eyes full of tears, he toys with her head

She said they'll only be joy when he's dead

So she killed him, no more will the minister touch

It's hell when it's Lucifer's luck you motherfuck

Call me the hunchback, for keeping my city on my spine

Paper before pussy, these haters is all rookies

I give them bowling ball nookies

No warning shots mister

I empty ammo crates for my palms got blisters

Lift them like a barbell, you sound like Marcel Duchamp

Execute rappers underwater, tie a wire to their wetsuit

Trash them and delete them

This is the winner takes it all
So take it all

Wasn't ready to be no millionaire, I was ill-prepared
I was prepared to be ill though, the skill was there
In the beginning, it wasn't 'bout the ends
It was 'bout busting raps and standing for something, fuck an acronym

Cut the fucking act like you're happy I'm fucking back again
With another anthem, why stop when it doesn't have to end?
It ain't over till I say it's over, enough when I say enough
Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up

I'm afraid of what'll happen to them wolves
When the thought of being thrown into an alligator pit, I salivated it
Raise your hands up like it's twelve noon, nah, homie
Hold them bitches straighter up, wave 'em till you dislocate a rotator cuff

Came up rough, came to ruffle feathers, nah, egos
I ain't deflate enough, last chance to make this whole stadium erupt

This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So take it all

I can see the finish line with each line that I finish
I'm so close to my goals I can almost pole vault over the goal post
And if I don't got enough in the tank, maybe I can just siphon enough
To fill up this last can, man will I survive in this climate or what?
They said I was washed up, and got a blood bath
I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter, I can adjust
Plus I can just walk up to a mic and just bust
So floor's open if you'd like to discuss

Top 5 in this mothafucka and if I don't make the cut
What, like I give a fuck, I will light this bitch up like I'm driving a truck
into the side of a pump, zero to 60 hop in and gun it
Like G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hyping 'em up

And if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut
And I look like I might just give up, eh you might've mistook
Me for bowing out, I ain't taking a bow, I'm stabbing myself
With a fucking knife in the gut, while I'm wiping my butt

'Cause I just shitted on the mic, and I like getting cut
I get excited at the sight of my blood, you're in a fight with a nut
'Cause I'mma fight till I die or win
Biting the dust it'll just make me angrier, wait

Let me remind you of what got me this far, picture me quitting
Now draw a circle around it and put a line through it, slut
It's survival of what?

This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So take it all

So get your ideas, stack your ammo
But don't come unless you come to battle, I'm mad now jump in the saddle
This is it, it's what you eat, sleep, piss and shit
Live, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this

Refuse to quit, fuse is lit, can't diffuse the wick
I don't do this music shit, I lose my shit
Ain't got shit to lose, it's the moment of truth
It's all I know how to do, as soon as I get thrown in the booth, I spit

But my respect is overdue, I'm showing you the flow no one do
'Cause I don't own no diploma for school, I quit
So there's nothing for me to fall back on, I know no other trades
So you'd better trade your fucking mics in for some toolboxes

Cause you'll never take my pride from me
It'll have to be pried from me, so pull out your pliers and your screwdrivers
But I want you to doubt me, I don't want you to believe
Cause this is something that I must use to succeed
And if you don't like me then fuck you
Self esteem must be fucking shooting through-the-roof cause trust me

My skin is too thick and bul-let proof to touch me
I can see why the fuck I disgust you, I must be
Allergic to failure 'cause every time I come close to it, I just sneeze
But I just go atchoo then achieve

And by the way, , why do they sing?
Am I the only one who realizes they stink?

Should I dye my hair pink and care what y'all think?
Lip sync and buy a bigger size of earrings?
It's why I tend to block out when I hear things
Cause all these fans screaming is making my ears ring (AHHHH!!!)

So I just, throw up a middle finger and let it linger
longer than the rumor that I was sticking it to Christina
'Cause if I ever stuck it to any singer in showbiz
It'd be Jennifer Lopez and Puffy you know this!

I'm sorry Puff, but I don't give a fuck if this chick was my own mother
I still fuck her with no rubber and cum inside her
And have a son and a new brother at the same time
And just say that it ain't mine, what's my name?

That's why they call me Slim Shady 
I'm Back  I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady 
I'm Back  I'm back

That's why they call me Slim Shady 
I'm Back  I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady 
I'm Back  I'm back

Guess who's b-back, back
Gue-gue-guess who's back (Hi mom!)
Guess who's back

(Chorus: Lloyd Banks)
Niggas Know what I'm about out here
I don't toot my own horn 'cause I don't have to
You can run your mouth I don't care
But if you get too close I'm gonna clap you
It's too real out here to be scared
A real nigga gonna do whatever he has to
A man is the last thing you should fear
It ain't considered a crime unless they catch you
We all die one day

(Tony Yayo: ""Obie Trice"")
(Obie Trice)
Niggas when I step up in the bar, faggots wanna look
Like you motherfuckers got Obie Trice shook
Like I'm gonna stand here as a man and
Let some queer ass funny looking nigga get the upper hand
I got issues, got no time, got guns that mourn nigga's moms
Shoot up clubs and destroy niggas' vibes
Everybody runnin' for their motherfucking lives
Tough club niggas, we leave early, cock back surely
Open up your fade, your grey brain meets motor city pave
Your nervous system still twitch off Jay Z
O's an animals skirts get mirked
Don't ever let a nigga tell you slugs don't hurt
Don't ever let a nigga tell you play the bar hard
Trust in God it 'cause you're about to catch a bullet scar
I give a fuck where you from who you be with
Keep this a secret right by the nuts
A 4-5 that'll light niggas up and this 4-5 high make me not give a fuck

(Tony Yayo: ""Lloyd Banks"")
(Lloyd Banks)
But as long as I'm here I'm gonna grab checks
And make my cash stretch longer than giraffe necks
Poverty'll make your ass bet on words
Touch niggas in jail make them wanna finish their last sents'
They say you live by the gun and die by the next nigga gun
If that's the case then get a bigga one
You don't think I pack the pump 'cause I'm out of the hood
That's a stereotype like everyone that's black can jump
I'm in a white mink, the fabric is done
Got rings that bling like Mike, Byrd, Magic and them
Out in Dallas in a palace where the Mavericks is from
Living lavish, I'm established, so the cabbage'll come
I'm the clouds you won't see me in the trains
I travel first class you don't even got a TV on your plane
You should be easy on my name, 'cause I don't going back and forth
Your boss and your captain's soft

(Tony Yayo: ""Yo Em spin that shit"")
(Eminem)
We gonna bring it to anybody who want it
You want it? you gonna get it
Name 'em, we gon' hit em, chew 'em up and spit 'em out
Too much venom and if you roll with 'em
We gonna fuck you up with 'em
I got too much momentum movin in my direction to lose
My shoes will explode as soon as you go to step in 'em (BROOM)
You know how we do it when we do how we do it when we come through
G-Unit, D-1-2 and Obie we all move like assassins
Ski mask and gloves consider this as a warning
Disaster comes faster than you can react to it, just ask Muggs
But we are fizzast, fuck your little bitch ass up
We are not killers, my vato will have you shot though
Drag through the barrio and fucked like Kim Osario
Little sorry hoe ass, go ask B Real
We burn source covers like fuckin' Cypress Hill
Did in the 90s, when you was in diapers still
Shady records you better believe the hype is real
This is no joke, I don't smoke
But I toke enough second hand to make my fuckin' P.O. choke
I'm an OG, you're fuckin' with a GI Joe
Bia Bia, mia meo a vida loco
I'm a psycho, Mariah ain't got shit on me
When I retire I'll be spittin' baby food on people
At San Pedro ranch, huddled up next to her
With Hello Kitty slippers on, humping her legs
You ever had your cat peeled back or your shit pushed in
I put my blade in you're like a fucking pin cushion
Slice your ear clear off, Smirnoff and Henn dog
I'll show you how to kill a fucking man like Sen Dog
Nobody told you that I'm loco S.A.?
I lack every sane chemical in my membrane
I'm slim sha-""D"" and the ""d"" is for deez nuts
And you can get each one for free so feast up
I pee in a cup for three months, I'm having an E party for Easter please come

(Tony Yayo: Here We Go)
(50 Cent)
We gonna bring it to anybody who want it
You want it? you gonna get it
Name em, we gon hit em, chew 'em up and spit 'em out
Too much venom and if you role with 'em
We gonna fuck you up with 'em
You can do all them push ups to pump up your chest
I got a 12 gauge Mossburg to pump up your chest
Have you gasping for breath after that shell hit your vest
Fear me like you fear god 'cause I bring death
Silverback gorrilla in the concrete jungle
I'm the strongest one around you know how I get down
I watch gangsta flicks and root for the bad guy
And turn it off before it ends cause the bad guy die
If you trying to buy guns I'm the nigga to look to
So what they got bodies on 'em, they still look new
You can raise your voice like you fin to touch something
When I raise my knife shit I'm fin to cut something
See I walk like Ron O'Neil and talk like Goldie
If the bitch think I love her the bitch don't know me

(Uh)
First verse, uh, I'm on till I'm on a island
My life's ridin' on the Autobahn on autopilot
Before I touch dirt, I'll kill you all with kindness
I kill ya, my natural persona's much worse

You've been warned if you've been born or if you conform
Slap up a cop and then snatch him out of his uniform
Leave him wit' his socks, hard bottoms and bloomers on
And hang him by his balls from the horn of a unicorn

Y'all niggas' intellect mad slow, y'all fags know
Claimin' you bangin', you flamin', bet you could light your own cigarette wit' ya asshole
Me and Shady deaded the past so that basically resurrected my cash flow
I might rap tight as the snatch of a fat dyke, though I ain't wrapped tight

My blood type's the '80s
My '90s was like the Navy
You was like the Bradys
You still fly kites daily

:
Catch me in my Mercedes, bumpin' ""Ice, Ice Baby,"" screamin' Shady till I die
Like a half a pair of dice, life's crazy so I live it to the fullest till I'm Swayze
And you only live it once, so I'm thinkin' 'bout this nice, nice lady
Wait, no, stop me now b'fore I get on a roll ()

Let me tell you what this pretty little dame's name is, 'cause she's kinda famous
And I hope that I don't sound too heinous when I say this
Nicki Minaj, but I wanna stick my penis in your anus
You morons think that I'm a genius

Really I belong inside a dang insane asylum, cleanin', try them trailer parks
Crazy, I am back, and I am razor-sharp, baby
And that's back wit' a capital B wit' an exclamation mark, maybe
You should listen when I flip the linguistics, 'cause I'm 'onna rip this mystical slick shit

You don't wanna become another victim or statistic of this shit
'Cause after I spit the bullets
I'ma treat these shell casings like a soccer ball I'ma kick the ballistics
So get this dick, I'ma live this

:
Livin' life in the fast lane
Movin' at the speed of life and I can't slow down
Only got a gallon in the gas tank
But I'm almost at the finish line, so I can't stop now

I don't really know where I'm headed, just enjoyin' the ride
Just gon' roll till I drop and ride till I die
I'm livin' life in the fast lane ()
Livin' life in the fast lane ()

:
My whole goal as a poet's to be relaxed in orbit
At war wit' a bottle, this Captain Morgan attacks my organs
My slow flow is euphoric, it's like I rap endorphins
I made a pact with the Devil that says ""I'll let you take me

You let me take this shovel, dig up the corpe's of Jack Kevorkian""
Go back and forth in more beef that you can pack a fork in
I'm livin' the life of the infinite enemy down, my tenement, too many now, to send my serenity powers
Spin 'em around, enterin' in the vicinity

:
Now, was called Eminem, but he threw away the candy and ate the rapper
Chewed him up (Pt!) and spitted him out
Girl, giddy-up, now get get down
He's lookin' around this club and it looks like people are havin' a shit fit-fit now

Here, little t-t-trailer trash, take a look who's back in t-t-town
Did I st-st-stutter, motherfucker, fuck the mall, he's just
A whole motherfuckin' Walmart d-d-down every time he comes a-r-r-round
And he came to the club tonight wit' 5'9"" to hold this bitch down

Like a motherfuckin' chick underwater, he tryna d-dr-drown, shawty when you dance you got me captivated
Just by the way that you keep lickin' them dicks like lips, I'm agitated, aggravated
To the point you don't suck my dick, then you're gonna get decapitated
Other words, you don't fuckin' give me head, then I'm have to take it

:
And then after takin' that, I'ma catch a case, it's gon' be fascinatin'
It's gonna say ""The whole rap game passed away"" on top of the affidavit
Graduated from master debater slash massive masturbator to Michael Jackson' activator (Woo)
Meanin' I'm on fire off the top, might wanna back up the data

Runnin' over hip-hop in a verbal tractor-trailer
Homey, this sick, you can normally ask a hater
Don't it make sense, these shell casings is just like a bag of paper
Drop in the lap of a tax evader (Homie, they spent)

:
Now make that ass drop, like a sack of potatoes, what girl I'm the crack-a-lator
Percolator this party, be my penis ejaculator later
Tell you boyfriend that you just struck paydirt
You rollin' wit' a player, you won't be exaggeratin' when you say you're livin'

But you gotta search within you, you gotta find that inner strength
And just pull that shit out of you and get that motivation to not give up
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse.

Yo left, yo left, yo left right left
Yo left, yo left, yo left right left
Yo left, yo left, yo left right left
Yo left, yo left, yo left right left

Till I collapse I’m spilling these raps long as you feel 'em
Till the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killing them
'Cause when I am not then I'ma stop penning 'em
And I am not hip-hop and I’m just not Eminem.
Subliminal thoughts when I'm stop sending them women are caught in webs spin and hauk venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illing to stop.
Amoxacilin is just not real enough.
The criminal cop killing hip-hop filling a minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners.
You're coming with me, feel it or not you’re gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of god lives in us.
You hear it a lot, lyrics that shock is it a miracle or am I just a product of pop fizzing up.
For sizzle my whizzle this is the plot listen up you bizzles forgot slizzle does not give a fuck.

Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps.
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps.
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.

Music is like magic there’s a certain feeling you get when you're real
And you spit and people are feeling your shit.
This is your moment and every single minute you spend trying to hold onto it
'cause you may never get it again.
So while you’re in it try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over just admit when it's at its end.
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half this shit that gets in.
I got a list here's the order of my list that it's in.
It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie, Andre from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me.
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy, so when I’m not put on this list the shit does not offend me.
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's bothering me.
Even though half you people got a fucking problem with me.
You hate it but you know respect you've got to give me
The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney. Nate hit me.

Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps.
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps.
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.

Soon as a verse starts I eat it at MC’s heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me? Smart.
And it's absurd how people hang on every word.
I’ll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I’ll never be served my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave earth that would be the death of me first.
'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse.
That’s why I’m clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I’m an addict
I rap like I’m addicted to smack like I’m Kim Mathers.
But I don’t want to go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers.
So this is like a full blown attack I’m launching at them
The track is on some battling raps who want some static
'Cause I don’t really think that the fact that I’m Slim matters
A plaque of platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest.

Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps.
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps.
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.

Play bishop I paint that picture now who got the juice
You niggas is nuts so, I take off your roof
Leave your ass streched out like a Cadillac Coupe
God gotta let me in Heaven all the shit I been through
I was an OG in the hood before I turned 22
Homey I'll let the .38 special rip through that vest
& I now Ion contemplatin' whether or not he left that shit on the dresser
Got Compton on my back
I'm startin' to feel the pressure
I'm lyrically Kool G. Rappin' these Dre Records.

If you take a look in my eyes
You see I'll be a gangsta 'til I die
That California chronic got me so high

Now understand the situation, it was urgent

We, handeled this emergency urgently

I can't just have no nigga out there just workin' me, jerkin' me

Talkin' all kind of shit, dishin dirt on me, shit

He was a local nigga sheisty and didn't wanna pay up

So I got dressed in all black and loaded the K up

And all I could think about is revenge as I lit the J up

And even though it was late night, I still fucked his whole day up



It was child's play, the youngster took me for a joke

Not knowin' Mack a maniac and I love the gun smoke

Make sparks in my barrel, shit flew through his apparel

Stupid motherfucker lost his life over dinero

Does that make me a quitter

I got rocks on my neck the size of bottle tops
And got glocks intellectual rob behind cops
On broke days we used to put water in our cereal
Now we crossing borders just to shoot another video
It's Tony Montano, full body armor
Soning niggas like Alfredo in Godfather
Two shot revolver, that Dillinger shit
In the A-R 15, Bentley or Six
We taking trips to Morocco just to tan
We smoke weed in restaurants in Amsterdam
I was worth a hundred grams, now I'm worth a cool million
I'll put money on your hairline, your dime and your children

(Chorus - Eminem)
I'm a Drama Setter, gripping my baretta sipping Armaretta
Man you crazy if you think Ima let up
I told you I'm a Drama Setter
I'll be the first to set it homie, you can bet it just don't get in the way of my chedda
Man 'cause I'm a Drama Setter
I don't go looking for no trouble but somehow the trouble always finds me
Don't make me have you in the trauma center
With you momma crying cause her only son is dying
She just don't know it's just your karma catching upcause I'm a Drama Setter

Since Yayo is home, them A-R's is drawn
Obie's Guerrila Unit, fuck affilia-tion
We are oneIt is sensless, for you to prevent this
The 40, cal'll put you up under some photosynthesis
At any given instantanother incident
You just got a glimpse of Obie and Yay's temperament
And we holding them K's that's why homie won't age
Isn't it that Tony's enraged they throw him in cages
But now my nigga's loose Our crews is bulletproof


All brought to you from whom's pupils, baby blues
His short fuses, put your portrait on the news
Nigga them screws is loose when you fucking with them shady dudes

Don't make me have you in the trauma center
With you momma crying cause her only son is dying
She just don't know it's just your karma catching upcause I'm a Drama Setter

(Verse 3 - Tony Yayo)

Got fat while I was gone, but now I'm here
And y'all rappers only bust shots only in fear
Chinchillas on my back itchy fingers on the mac
Get scrilla off of crack, get fifty's shooter back
Listen homie, don't let them niggas amp you money
'Cause I got niggas in Queens that kill for pamper money
Move like Kaiser, Jayson Williams slaughter the driver
My daughter Maniyah, know that the kid spit fire
Reality rap, nigga check my salary cap
I give guns to my soldiers with a battery pack
What you know about light planes and heavy coke
And them drugs being smuggled on them fast speed boats
It's the rap tycoon, Tony you all know me
See me on MTV I'm a parole
I was out for 12 hours and went right back in
For three hots and 1 cot doin' time in the pen

(Chorus - Eminem)
I'm a Drama Setter, gripping my baretta sipping Armaretta
Man you crazy if you think Ima let up
I told you I'm a Drama Setter
I'll be the first to set it homie, you can bet it just don't get in the way of my chedda

Gotta love it, 'cause I expose the fasciad
Your little lungs is too small to hot box with God

All jokes aside, come bounce wit us
Standing over you with a 12 gauge about to bust
It's like ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I might leave in a body bag, but never in cuffs

Livin' the urban life like a white kid from the 'burbs
Dreamin' at night and screamin' at mom's schemin' to leave
Run away from home and grow to be as evil as me

I just want you all to notice me and people to see
That somewhere deep down is a decent human being in me
It just can't be found, so the reason you've been seeing this me
Is 'cause this is me now, the recent dude is being this mean

So when you see me dressin' up like a nerd on TV
Or heard tea CD using the fag word so freely
It's just me being me, here want me to tone it down
Suck my fuckin' dick, you faggot

Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin' with real life

Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics

And show these people what my level of skill's like

But I'm still white, sometimes I just hate life

Somethin ain't right, hit the brake lights

Case of the stage fright, drawin a blank like

Da-duh-duh-da-da, it ain't my fault

Great big eyeballs, my insides crawl

And I clam up  I just slam shut

I just can't do it, my whole manhood's

Just been stripped, I have just been vicked

So I must then get, off the bus then split

Man fuck this shit; yo, I'm goin' the fuck home

World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road



I'm a man, I'mma make a new plan

Time for me to just stand up, and travel new land

Time to really just take matters into my own hands

Once I'm over these tracks man I'mma never look back

(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin Sorry momma I'm grown, I must travel alone

Ain't gon' follow the footsteps I'm makin' my own

Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road



I'm walkin' these train tracks, tryin' to regain back

The spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap

To the same plant, and the same pants

Tryin' to chase rap, gotta move ASAP

And get a new plan, momma's got a new man

Poor little baby sister, she don't understand

Sits in front of the TV, buries her nose in the pad

And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand

While she colors her big brother and mother and dad

Ain't no tellin' what really goes on in her little head

Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had

But I keep runnin' from somethin' I never wanted so bad!

Sometimes I get upset, cause I ain't blew up yet

It's like I grew up, but I ain't grow me two nuts yet

Don't gotta rep my step, don't got enough pep

The pressure's too much man, I'm just tryin' to do what's best

And I try, sit alone and I cry

Yo I won't tell no lie, not a moment goes by

That I don't pray to the sky, please I'm beggin' you God

Please don't let me be pigeonholed in no regular job

Yo I hope you can hear me homey wherever you are

Yo I'm tellin' you dawg I'm bailin' this trailer tomorrow

Tell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye

Say whenever you need me baby, I'm never too far

But yo I gotta get out there, the only way I know

And I'mma be back for you, the second that I blow

On everything I own, I'll make it on my own

Off to work I go, back to this 8 Mile Road



I'm a man, I'mma make a new plan

Time for me to just stand up, and travel new land

Time to really just take matters into my own hands

Once I'm over these tracks man I'mma never look back

Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road



You gotta live it to feel it, you didn't you wouldn't get it

Or see what the big deal is, why it was and it still is

To be walkin this borderline of Detroit city limits

It's different, it's a certain significance, a certificate

Of authenticity, you'd never even see

But it's everything to me, it's my credibility

You never seen heard smelled or met a real MC

Who's incredible upon the same pedestal as me

But yet I'm still unsigned, havin' a rough time

Sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes

Go to work and serve MCs in the lunchline

But when it comes crunch time, where do my punchlines go

Who must I show, to bust my flow

Where must I go, who must I know

Or am I just another crab in the bucket

Cause I ain't havin' no luck with this little Rabbit foot so fuck it

Maybe I need a new outlet, I'm startin to doubt shit

I'm feelin' a little skeptical who I hang out with

I look like a bum, yo my clothes ain't about shit

At the Salvation Army tryin to salvage an outfit

And it's cold, tryin' to travel this road

Plus I feel like I'm on stuck in this battlin mode

My defenses are so up, but one thing I don't want

Is pity from no one, the city is no fun

There is no sun, and it's so dark

Sometimes I feel like I'm just bein' pulled apart

From each one of my limbs, by each one of my friends

It's enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin

Sometimes I feel like a robot, sometimes I just know not

What I'm doin I just blow, my head is a stove top

I just explode, the kettle gets so hot

Sometimes my mouth just overloads the ass that I don't got

But I've learned, it's time for me to U-turn

Yo it only takes one time for me to get burned

Ain't no fallin' no next time I meet a new girl

I can no longer play stupid or be immature

I got every ingredient, all I need is the courage

Like I already got the beat, all I need is the words

Got the urge, suddenly it's a surge

Suddenly a new burst of energy has occurred

Time to show these free world leaders the 3 and a third

I am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird

Then I turn and cross over the median curb

Hit the 'burbs and all you see is a blur from 8 Mile Road



I'm a man, I'mma make a new plan

Time for me to just stand up, and travel new land

Time to really just take matters into my own hands

Once I'm over these tracks man I'mma never look back

In my affiliation to the Gangsta Nation
I'm hard on them, yeah I'm ruthless
You like stick pussy, nigga you useless
You know the side bitch, better get up on it
Cause it must be a single with Nate Dogg singin' on it


Look here man, check this out man, look

And join this Westside thing man
'Cause we got a mother fuckin' gangsta nation goin' over here
And once you join this shit you as G as can motha fuckin' be

Smashing grabs in no deets

Brody Dave had the squares

Rockstar with them tears

I was juugin' like I'm Rick Ross

Losing weight eating pears

Teeth and neck or Smart Water

Richy Rich, I'm that Porter

Send a lamb to that slaughter

Slaught it, chopper 9 to that quarter

Niggas talk but don't bang (Bow!)

Niggas sell but don't slang, damn

Judge got bacon in, damn, oh man

They so nice in that can (free 'em)

Flowers and snakes on my garments (Gucci)

I fuck models in apartments

Eating dinners as my starters

Tryna hit the belly, no Cartman

Shotty make a nigga cartwheel

I had money for the half deal

Hoe shot me down with a crossbow

Now I don't know how a heart feel

I got uncles and they aren't Phil

If she ain't fucking, she can't chill

Real niggas zip up the trackies, uh

That's a savage, you can ask Dill

I used to say a bag on the outfit casual

Now it's ten bag when I step out

Couldn't buy a trim back then, I was stressed out

Now peng tings get their chest out

Mediclinic incline forever feeling that the sky is better

Sky is not the limit my attitude will disguise the weather

Under my sweater I'm feeling as if I'm under pressure

I need a Smith and Wesson

You say I need a lecture

I got a dead brother plus I've never seen my mother

Question my feelings of her

Asking me if I still love her



Get the product then we out the door

Mama I've been twistin' weed

And now it's time to lock the fro, blowin' dro

Call me knotty head cause I don't give a fuck

I was raised off in the projects, know this life ain't meant for us

Bitch I can't be touched

Get the product then we out the door

Mama I've been twistin' weed

And now it's time to lock the fro, let it go

Call me knotty head and if I ever go

Tell my mama that I love her cause tomorrow not for sure

I would never know



Tote a 4 and pour some liq'

I'ma tote that stick until they send me to the pen

This the way it is, I gotta get it how I live

Knotty headed niggas

Told her I might hit a lick

I'ma tote that stick until they send me to the pen

This the way it is, I gotta get it how I live

Found another body in the lake

Same day another tattoo on his face

Obituary on his mother's fireplace

Baby mother fuck another sucker on a blind date

Shots fired every night I'm tryna mind mine

Dolphin Gang, Bello cigars on the sideline

Pussy niggas you can see it on his timeline

Hatin' on his dawg, shit I'm tryna find mine

Calm nigga when I'm lit up I get Von Miller

Rich niggas if you real then you can run with us

Educated reading books I'm talkin Art of War

Whippin yoda yayo residue on the marble floors

I wanna see my niggas with the flyest clothes

Came to put my city on that's if I'm right or wrong

Pulling into Risco Park in the richest cars

And I'm thinking of my dawgs since I'm livin wrong

Jehovah's witness swear to God I done seen it all

Picking up the pistols every time the dogs bark

You pointing fingers but them choppers cutting arms off

Sometimes I wonder

How I keep from going under



We scream, ""Black Lives Matter,"" but we still toting ladders

Watching our own brothers trying to get at us

Dreams get shattered when a scene full of crackers

And they charge you with some shit you ain't do

You like what happen

We go get lawyers to say shit, we don't know how to talk

They told us to hate each other before we learn how to walk

Momma taught you how to fight, fight,

before she taught you how to write, write

And daddy locked down in the cell, can't kiss you night, night

Ma, she's under the bed every night, feel like it's fright night

Coke fumes in the air, mama holding on that pipe tight

And you catching contact, but never mind that

In a world where Black is wrong and white right

It's like a combat, we go to war for our freedom, they say we equal

I used to wanna play like Randall and be an Eagle

I used to play the quarterback, my dog would go receiver

That was 'til ball got flat by a dope needle on the pavement

It's amazing, this environment we was raised in

On them papers, one mistake and getting caged in

You gotta feel me, feel like the system trying to kill me

Got arrested and the charges F1 for popping wheelies, stay woke



It was designed for us to fail

Still prevail through the hell

Though it was designed for us to lose

To make it through nothing's impossible

Believe it we're still undefeated

Picture me ten years younger with some tats on my face

Taking a bunch of Xannys with the strap on my waist

Pointing at the camera like mama ain't teach me manners

Moving a little rock like I'm heading to Alabama, no, wait

I can't judge them, I'm just trying to understand them

Cause I used to pop Percs, pouring purple in my Phantom

Had me swerving in my Phantom like I'm running from my dreams

I was heading for the slammer,

I was planting all the seed for them to bury me

I had my whole family mad at me

Feel deep in love with the game and it married me

Judge said, ""I'll give you a chance, just don't embarrass me""

Motivating these little niggas is like a charity

Community service even though they knew we was working

They did this to me on purpose, 'cause I ain't moving too perfect

I stay away from them clowns, watch how I move through the surface

Cause they be weighing you down,

even some of them dudes in your circle



It was designed for us to fail

Still prevail through the hell

Though it was designed for us to lose

Nothing, nothing, nothing's impossible

Believe it, we're still undefeated



How can I pledge allegiance to the flag

When they killing all our sons all our dads?

I come from a place

When you kill your own brother you can brag

Like he got bodies, but that's a fad, no, that's a fact

I'm screaming out at your corner, nigga, that's a trap

Screaming out, that's your homie, nigga, that's a rack

Catch a case with him, bet he crack

Odds against you and they double stack stay woke

Bought my mama a new crib, that's some gangster shit

Niece and nephews walking around wearing minks and shit

Keep the hood motivated, this the thanks I get

Try to Ja Rule the kid on some Wanksta shit

But that's impossible 'cause I'm unstoppable

The label can't drop me, nigga, I'm too valuable

You thought I would lose but I won and that bothered you

Still move around in Philly just like the mobsters do

When I talked to Em and Hov, they said, ""I'm proud of you

You stood tall when everyone doubted you""

My reply is, ""I do what I gotta do

And I need that verse before you retire too""

Jumping all the obstacles, I'm way too wavy

Said I would lose but you way too crazy

Pick and choose either fame or the money fame will make you crazy

As long as you place me amongst one of them greats

Slap up a cop and then snatch him out of his uniform
Leave him wit' his socks, hard bottoms and bloomers on
And hang him by his balls from the horn of a unicorn

You let me take this shovel, dig up the corpe's of Jack Kevorkian""

Livin' life in the fast lane
Movin' at the speed of life and I can't slow down
Only got a gallon in the gas tank

Do the rap and the track, triple double no assist
And my only focus is staying on some bogus shit
Argue with my older bitch acting like I owe her shit
I heard that people sing raps to give the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fuckin' up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane
Chi nigga but these hoes love my accent
Chick came up to me and said, ""This the number to dial
If you wanna make your number one your number two now
This that goose and malibu, I call it Malibooyah""
Goddamn, Yeezy, how he hit 'em with the new style
Throw that motherfucker, ""Well, whatchu gon' do now?
Whatever ever I wanna do, gosh it's cool now""

Wasn't ready to be no millionaire, I was ill-prepared
I was prepared to be ill though, the skill was there
In the beginning, it wasn't 'bout the ends
It was 'bout busting raps and standing for something, fuck an acronym

Cut the fucking act like you're happy I'm fucking back again
With another anthem, why stop when it doesn't have to end?
It ain't over till I say it's over, enough when I say enough
Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up

I'm afraid of what'll happen to them wolves
When the thought of being thrown into an alligator pit, I salivated it
Raise your hands up like it's twelve noon, nah, homie
Hold them bitches straighter up, wave 'em till you dislocate a rotator cuff

Came up rough, came to ruffle feathers, nah, egos
I ain't deflate enough, last chance to make this whole stadium erupt

This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So take it all

I can see the finish line with each line that I finish
I'm so close to my goals I can almost pole vault over the goal post
And if I don't got enough in the tank, maybe I can just siphon enough
To fill up this last can, man will I survive in this climate or what?
They said I was washed up, and got a blood bath
I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter, I can adjust
Plus I can just walk up to a mic and just bust
So floor's open if you'd like to discuss

Top 5 in this mothafucka and if I don't make the cut
What, like I give a fuck, I will light this bitch up like I'm driving a truck
into the side of a pump, zero to 60 hop in and gun it
Like G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hyping 'em up

And if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut
And I look like I might just give up, eh you might've mistook
Me for bowing out, I ain't taking a bow, I'm stabbing myself
With a fucking knife in the gut, while I'm wiping my butt

'Cause I just shitted on the mic, and I like getting cut
I get excited at the sight of my blood, you're in a fight with a nut
'Cause I'mma fight till I die or win
Biting the dust it'll just make me angrier, wait

Let me remind you of what got me this far, picture me quitting
Now draw a circle around it and put a line through it, slut

So get your ideas, stack your ammo
But don't come unless you come to battle, I'm mad now jump in the saddle
This is it, it's what you eat, sleep, piss and shit
Live, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this

Refuse to quit, fuse is lit, can't diffuse the wick
I don't do this music shit, I lose my shit
Ain't got shit to lose, it's the moment of truth
It's all I know how to do, as soon as I get thrown in the booth, I spit

But my respect is overdue, I'm showing you the flow no one do
'Cause I don't own no diploma for school, I quit
So there's nothing for me to fall back on, I know no other trades
So you'd better trade your fucking mics in for some toolboxes

Cause you'll never take my pride from me
It'll have to be pried from me, so pull out your pliers and your screwdrivers
But I want you to doubt me, I don't want you to believe
Cause this is something that I must use to succeed
And if you don't like me then fuck you
Self esteem must be fucking shooting through-the-roof cause trust me

My skin is too thick and bul-let proof to touch me
I can see why the fuck I disgust you, I must be
Allergic to failure 'cause every time I come close to it, I just sneeze

Or understand the intelligence that Jay-Z has
I'm from rags to riches, niggas; I ain't dumb

The year is '94, in my trunk is raw
In my rearview mirror is the motherfuckin' law
Got two choices, y'all: pull over the car or 
Bounce on the devil; put the pedal to the floor
And I ain't tryin' to see no highway chase with Jake
Plus I got a few dollars; I can fight the case
So I pull over to the side of the road
I heard, ""Son, do you know what I'm stoppin' you for?""
""Cause I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low
Do I look like a mind reader, sir?  I don't know
Am I under arrest or should I guess some mo'?""
""Well, you was doin' fifty-five in a fifty-four"" (uh-huh)
""License and registration and step out of the car
Are you carryin' a weapon on you? I know a lot of you are""
""I ain't steppin out of shit; all my paper's legit""
""Well, do you mind if I look around the car a little bit?""
""Well, my glove compartment is locked, so is the trunk in the back
And I know my rights, so you gon' need a warrant for that"" (ha-ha)
""Aren't you sharp as a tack?
You some type of lawyer or somethin', somebody important or somethin'?""
""Child, I ain't passed the bar, but I know a little bit
Enough that you won't illegally search my shit""
""Well, we'll see how smart you are when the canine comes""

Now once upon a time, not too long ago
A nigga like myself had to strongarm a hoe
This is not a hoe in the sense of havin' a pussy
But a pussy havin' no goddamn sense; try and push me
I try to ignore him, talk to the Lord
Pray for him, but some fools just love to perform
You know the type, loud as a motorbike
But wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight
And only thing that's gon' happen is I'ma get to (whoo!) clappin' and
He and his boys gon' be yappin' to the captain
And there I go, trapped in the kit-kat again
Back through the system with the riff-raff again
Fiends on the floor, scratchin' again
Paparazzis with they cameras, snappin' them
D.A. try to give a nigga shaft again
Half a mill' for bail cause I'm African
All because this fool was harassin' them
Tryin to play the boy like he's saccharine (uh-uh)
But ain't nuttin sweet, 'bout how I hold my gun
I got 99 problems; bein' a bitch ain't one; hit me

99 problems, but a bitch ain't one

It just usually jus' evolves into one big brawl and we all get involved in it

We should all get a merit, as much beef we inherit

And wear it like a badge of honor, pass it around and share it

And let it go to whoevers holdin' the most current beef on their shoulders

And their soldiers got their backs till it's over

But tonight, we ain't comin' here to beef with nobody

We came to party, Banks, Cashis and Mr. Ferrari

So it's shady after-mizz-ath back in that ass, you izz-ass

Come izzon what kinda fizz-uckin' question is that

Who run it?

You know, you actin' like you don't know.

I tear the club up fo' sho

This flow is gon' bring more dough

And you know but actin' like you don't know



Who run it?



You know, you actin' like you don't know

I tear the club up fo' sho

This flow is gon' bring more dough

And you know but actin' like you don't know {cashis, break it down now!}

Pistol play, ricochet, see where the victim lay

Slumped over bleedin', JFK

HK to your chest plate

Cave out and ride till the death, do you rep that way



Forever I'ma be a shady 7-4 gangster



Plus I survived everything you got in that chamber

I thrived off-a danger, jumpin' in all beef

You keep talkin' shit, now the squad called me.

Enough holdin' back the steam (uh), Em let off a magazine

Dappadon cappa-queens, mixed in with Cashis creams (yeah)

Started off with half a dream, developed into what you see

Tellin' ain't my cup of tea, can't tell I'm a f**kin' g

I'ma hold a 'matic, when I'm at it, start static and you splattered



Shit shattered, I'm a walkin' bitch magnet



Spit it how I live it, live it all the way to the limit

And I'm always on my pivot for my digits, you dig it.

We run it! You know, you actin' like you don't know

I tear the club up fo' sho

This flow is gon' bring more dough

And you know but you actin' like you don't know

Who run it? You know, you actin' like you don't know

I tear the club up fo' sho

This flow is gon' bring more dough

And you know but you actin' like you don't know

Who run it?

You know what this is.

Shady. G-unit. Aftermath.

Lloyd banks... Cashis... Marshall Mathers... Ferrari F-50...

But you gotta search within you, you gotta find that inner strength
And just pull that shit out of you and get that motivation to not give up
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse.

Yo left, yo left, yo left right left
Yo left, yo left, yo left right left
Yo left, yo left, yo left right left
Yo left, yo left, yo left right left

Till I collapse I’m spilling these raps long as you feel 'em
Till the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killing them
'Cause when I am not then I'ma stop penning 'em
And I am not hip-hop and I’m just not Eminem.
Subliminal thoughts when I'm stop sending them women are caught in webs spin and hauk venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illing to stop.
Amoxacilin is just not real enough.
The criminal cop killing hip-hop filling a minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners.
You're coming with me, feel it or not you’re gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of god lives in us.
You hear it a lot, lyrics that shock is it a miracle or am I just a product of pop fizzing up.
For sizzle my whizzle this is the plot listen up you bizzles forgot slizzle does not give a fuck.

Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps.
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps.
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.

Music is like magic there’s a certain feeling you get when you're real
And you spit and people are feeling your shit.
This is your moment and every single minute you spend trying to hold onto it
'cause you may never get it again.
So while you’re in it try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over just admit when it's at its end.
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half this shit that gets in.
I got a list here's the order of my list that it's in.
It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie, Andre from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me.
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy, so when I’m not put on this list the shit does not offend me.
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's bothering me.
Even though half you people got a fucking problem with me.
You hate it but you know respect you've got to give me
The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney. Nate hit me.

Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps.
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps.
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.

Soon as a verse starts I eat it at MC’s heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me? Smart.
And it's absurd how people hang on every word.
I’ll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I’ll never be served my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave earth that would be the death of me first.
'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse.
That’s why I’m clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I’m an addict
I rap like I’m addicted to smack like I’m Kim Mathers.
But I don’t want to go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers.
So this is like a full blown attack I’m launching at them
The track is on some battling raps who want some static
'Cause I don’t really think that the fact that I’m Slim matters
A plaque of platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest.

Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps.
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps.
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.

Holla if you feel like  you've been down the same road

You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper, before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words, before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'ma do somethin' I do it, I don't give a damn

What you think, I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world feed it beans
It's gassed up, if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who looked down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony

No if ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From  down to the last  album, he's still shittin'
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him

Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a ""fuck you"" for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the earth, he's got the urge
To pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole universe

I'm not afraid  to take a stand 
Everybody , come take my hand 
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

OK quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm, for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth, for that
Fuck your feelin's, instead of gettin' crowned you're gettin' capped

And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact
Let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was eh
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground

Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack-bloww
'Cause I ain't playin' around, there's a game called circle
And I don't know how, I'm way too up to back down

But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud
Still follows me around, but it's time to exorcise these demons
These motherfuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now

And I just can't keep livin' this way
So startin' today, I'm breakin' out of this cage
I'm standin' up, I'ma face my demons
I'm mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, believe me you

I been through the ringer, but they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead, no more beef flingers

No more drama from now on, I promise
To focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof, like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it

'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
'Cause I'm raisin' the bar, I shoot for the moon
But I'm too busy gazin' at stars, I feel amazin' and I'm not

Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come trying to censor you
Like that one line I said on ""I'm Back"" from The Mathers LP
One where I tried to say I'd take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm

So that anything you say is ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
Oh, he's too mainstream
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
It's not hip-hop, it's pop, 'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on Lose Yourself and make 'em lose it

I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I’m ripping any one of these verses diverse as you
It’s curtains, I’m inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to prove
That if you were half as nice, your songs and you could sacrifice virgins too

School flunky, pill junky
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you, ill when I speak in tongues
But it's still tongue and cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel, I'm asleep in the front seat
Bumping Heavy D. & The Boyz, still chunky, but funky
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me

They asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I had
Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation
Understand the discrimination

But fuck it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then
But if I can't batter the women how the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
Don't mistake it for Satan
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas
And take a vacation to trip a broad
And make her fall on her face and don't be a retard

Got 'em still on the fence ready to pick it

Alright, let's do this



When I pretend everything is what I want it to be

I look exactly like what you always wanted to see

When I pretend, I can't forget about the criminal I am

Stealing second after second just cause I know I can but

I can't pretend this is the way it'll stay I'm just

Trying to bend the truth

I can't pretend I'm who you want me to be, so I'm

Lying my way from

Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off

Niggaz is crazy baby, don't forget that boy told you

Get, that, dirt off your shoulder



I probably owe it to y'all, proud to be locked by the force

Tryin to hustle some things, that go with the Porsche

Feelin no remorse, feelin like my hand was forced

Middle finger to the law, nigga grip'n my balls

All the ladies they love me, from the bleachers they screamin

All the ballers is bouncin they like the way I be leanin

All the rappers be hatin, off the track that I'm makin

But all the hustlers they love it just to see one of us make it

Came from the bottom the bottom, to the top of the pots

Tryin to stretch out the coca, like a wrestler, yessir

Keep the Heckler close, you know them smokers'll test ya

Now fifty-two bars come out, now you feel 'em

Now, fifty-two cars roll out, remove ceiling

In case fifty-two broads come out, now you chillin

with a boss bitch of course S.C. on the sleeve





At the 40/40 club, ESPN on the screen

I paid a grip for the jeans, plus the slippers is clean

No chrome on the wheels, I'm a grown-up for real, chill



Yeah, I remember what they taught to me

Remember condescending talk of who I ought to be

Remember listening to all of that and this again

So I pretended up a person who was fittin' in

And now you think this person really is me and I'm

Trying to bend the truth

But the more I push the more I'm pulling away cause I'm



Lying my way from you

And the red sun sinks at last into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior without the sound of guns

If I could recollect before my hood days
I'd sit and reminisce, Thinkin' of bliss and the good days
I stop and stare at the younger, my heart goes to'em
They tested, it was stressed that they under
In our days, things changed
Everyone's ashamed to the youth 'cause the truth looks strange
And for me it's reversed, we left them a world that's cursed, and it hurts
Cause any day they'll push the button
And all good men like Malcolm X and Bobby Hunton, died for nothin'
Don't them let me get teary, the world looks dreary
But when you wipe your eyes, see it clearly
There's no need for you to fear me
If you take the time to hear me, maybe you can learn to cheer me
It ain't about black or white, 'cause we're human
I hope we see the light before its ruined

Living out a bag, but she's glad for the little things she has
And over there there's a lady, crack got her crazy
Guess she's given birth to a baby
I don't trip and let it fade me, from outta the frying pan
We jump into another form of slavery
Even now I get discouraged
Wonder if they take it all back while I still keep the courage
I refuse to be a role model
I set goals, take control, drink out my own bottle
I make mistakes, but learn from every one
And when its said and done
I bet this Brotha be a better one
If I'm upset, you don't stress
Never forget, that God hasn't finished with me yet
I feel his hand on my brain
When I write rhymes, I go blind, and let the Lord do his thang
But am I less holy
'Cause I choose to puff a blunt and drink a beer with my homies
Before we find world peace
We gotta find peace in that war on the streets

America got a thing for this gangsta' shit, they love me
Black Chuckas, black skullies, leather Pelle-Pelle
I take Spit over Raymo shit, I'm a vandal
Got the silver duct tape on my tray eight handle
The women in my life be confusion and shit
SO like Nino when New Jack, I holla ""cancel that bitch""
Look at me, this is the life I chose
Niggaz around me so cold, man my heart dun froze
I built an empire on the low the narc's don't know
I'm the weatherman
I take that cocoa leaf and make that snow
Sit back, watch it turn to dough, watch it go out the door
O after O, you know, homie I'm just triple beam, dreamin'
Niggaz be schemin', I fiend to live a good life
The fiends are just fiendin
Conceal my weapon nice and easy so you can't see
The penitentiary is definitely out the question for me...

I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (hustle)

And I'll buck you (buck you)
I don't care who you run with, or where you from
Nigga fuck you (fuck you)

Yeah, I don't know shit about gymnastics I summersault bricks
Black Talons start flyin, when a nigga flip
I cook crack in the microwave, niggaz can't fuck with me
Man my code name, they called me chef boy r 50
Check my logic, smokers don't like seeds in their weed, shit
Send me them seeds I'll grow 'em what they need
Them ain't chia pet plants in the crib, that's chronic
And I'm sellin 'em for 500 a pop god damn it
I sell anything I'ma hustler, I know how to grind


Step on grapes put in water and tell you it's wine
If you analyze me, what you'll find is the DNA of a crook and
What goes in my mind, its contagious
Hypnotic, it sounds melodic
If rap was the block or spot, I'll be potent product
Now get a load of me, flashy, far from low key
And you can locate me where ever that dope be, gettin' money man

I want the finer things in my life

It's a hustler's ambition, close your eyes listen, see my vision
Moussberg pumpin, shotgun dumpin' the drama means nothin'
It's part of the game, catch me in the coupe switchin lanes
Or in the jewler switchin chains
I upgrade from 30 Bs to clean Vs
Rocks that I copped proceeds from the spot
I got the energy to win, I'm full of adrenaline
Play the curv and get nauseous, watchin the spinner spin
I'ma plan to make it, a prisoner of the state
Now I can invite yo ass out to my estate
Them hollow tips bent me up, but I'm back in shape
Pour Crystal in the blender and make a protein shake
I'm like the East coast number one playboy B
Hugh Hefner will tell you he ain't got shit on me
The feds watch me, Icey, they can't stop me
Racist, pointin at me look at the niggaracci

Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing

To see him walking around with his headphones blaring
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care
He's a problem child and what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out

'Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
But if he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are whacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap

He sags his pants, do-rags and a stocking cap
His stepfather hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose, his house is a broken home
There's no control, he just lets his emotions go


 Sing with me,  for the year 
For the laughter, sing for the tear 
Sing it with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangstas
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely 'cause don't anyone know me

Yet everybody just feels like they can relate
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great
Or they can degrade, or even worse they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make

Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass

But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad

So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly

But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously
So I'm signin' CDs while police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense B

It's all political, if my music is literal
And I'm a criminal how the fuck can I raise a little girl
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you

For the laughter, sing for the tears (Sing with me!)

They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well can it load a gun up for you and cock it too
Well if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued

See what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
And they want to get one 'cause they think the shit's cool
Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves, we entertainers
Of course the shit's affectin' our sales, you ignoramus

But music is reflection of self, we just explain it
And then we get our checks in the mail, it's fucked up ain't it
How we can come from practically nothing
To being able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted

That's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing
Except for a dream, and a fuckin' rap magazine
Who post pin-up pictures on their walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs

Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
Till they sit and they cry at night, wishin' they'd die
Till they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
We're nothin' to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes

That's why we, seize the moment try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it, 'cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone just let our spirits live on
Through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can

Sing with me,  for the year 
For the laughter, sing for the tears 
Sing it with me, if it's just for today

0, Eminem,angry_Till-I-Collapse_Eminem_ytQ5CYE1VZw.mp3,"Feel weak, and when you feel weak, you feel like you wanna just give up.
But you gotta search within you, you gotta find that inner strength
And just pull that shit out of you and get that motivation to not give up
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse.

Yo left, yo left, yo left right left
Yo left, yo left, yo left right left
Yo left, yo left, yo left right left
Yo left, yo left, yo left right left

Till I collapse I’m spilling these raps long as you feel 'em
Till the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killing them
'Cause when I am not then I'ma stop penning 'em
And I am not hip-hop and I’m just not Eminem.
Subliminal thoughts when I'm stop sending them women are caught in webs spin and hauk venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illing to stop.
Amoxacilin is just not real enough.
The criminal cop killing hip-hop filling a minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners.
You're coming with me, feel it or not you’re gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of god lives in us.
You hear it a lot, lyrics that shock is it a miracle or am I just a product of pop fizzing up.
For sizzle my whizzle this is the plot listen up you bizzles forgot slizzle does not give a fuck.

Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps.
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps.
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.

Music is like magic there’s a certain feeling you get when you're real
And you spit and people are feeling your shit.
This is your moment and every single minute you spend trying to hold onto it
'cause you may never get it again.
So while you’re in it try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over just admit when it's at its end.
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half this shit that gets in.
I got a list here's the order of my list that it's in.
It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie, Andre from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me.
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy, so when I’m not put on this list the shit does not offend me.
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's bothering me.
Even though half you people got a fucking problem with me.
You hate it but you know respect you've got to give me
The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney. Nate hit me.

Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps.
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps.
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.

Soon as a verse starts I eat it at MC’s heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me? Smart.
And it's absurd how people hang on every word.
I’ll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I’ll never be served my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave earth that would be the death of me first.
'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse.
That’s why I’m clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I’m an addict
I rap like I’m addicted to smack like I’m Kim Mathers.
But I don’t want to go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers.
So this is like a full blown attack I’m launching at them
The track is on some battling raps who want some static
'Cause I don’t really think that the fact that I’m Slim matters
A plaque of platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest.

Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps.
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps.
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.

Until the roof (Until the roof)
The roof comes off (The roof comes off)
Until my legs (Until my legs)
Give out from underneath me (Give out form underneath me)

I, I will not fall,
I will stand tall,
Feels like no one can beat me.",angry, Till I Collapse,ytQ5CYE1VZw

In a white tee lookin' for wifie

Put her in the coupe so she can feel the nice breeze

My live niggaz lit up the reefer
Trunk at the car we got the street sweeper
Don't start none, won't be none no reason for your man's to panic
You don't wanna see no ambulances
Knock a pimp's drink down in his pimp cup
That's the way you get Timberland'd up
Let the music diffuse all attention
Ball or convention, free admission
Hustlers, dealers and killers'can move swift
Girls get close, you'ca feel where the tool's kept
All my just-comin' homies, parolees
Get money, leave the beef alone slowly
Get out my face, you people so phoney
Pull out my waist, the eagle fo-forty

Yo, all I need is one mic, one beat, one stage
One nigga front, my face on the front page
Only if I had one gun, one girl and one crib
One God to show me how to do things his son did
Pure, like a cup of virgin blood; mixed with
151, one sip'll make a nigga flip
Writin names on my hollow tips, plottin shit
Mad violence who I'm gon' body, this hood politics
Ackowledge it, leave bodies chopped in garbages
Seeds watch us, grow up and try to follow us
Police watch us roll up and try knockin' us
One knee I ducked, could it be my time is up
But my luck, I got up, the cop shot again
Bus stop glass bursts, a fiend drops his heineken
Richochetin between the spots that I'm hidin in
Blackin out as I shoot back, fuck gettin' hit!
This is my hood I'ma rep, to the death of it
Till everybody come home, little niggaz is grown
Hoodrats, don't abortion your womb, we need more warriors soon
Sip from the star sun and the moon
In this life of police chases street sweepers and coppers
Stick-up kids with no conscience, leavin' victims with doctors
If you really think you ready to die, with nines out
This is what nas is bout, nigga the time is now!

All I need is one mic... that's all I need
All I need is one mic... all I need niggaz
All I need is one mic... yeah

(Gradually getting louder)
All I need is one blunt, one page, and one pen
One prayer - tell God forgive for one sin
Matter fact maybe more than one, look back
At all the hatred against me, fuck alla them
Jesus died at age 33, there's thirty-three shots
From twin glocks there's sixteen apiece, that's thirty-two
Which means, one of my guns was holdin' 17
Twenty-seven hit your crew, six went into you
Everybody gotta die sometime; hope your funeral
Never gets shot up, bullets tear through the innocent
Nothin' is fair, niggaz roll up, shootin from wheelchairs
My heart is racin, tastin revenge in the air
I let the shit slide for too many years, too many times
Now I'm strapped with a couple of macs, too many nines
If y'all niggaz really wit me get busy load up the semis
Do more than just hold it explode the clip until you empty
There's nothin' in our way - they bust, we bust, they rust, we rust
Led flyin, feel it? I feel it in my gut
That we take these bitches to war, lie 'em down
'Cause we stronger now my nigga the time is now!

All I need is one mic... there's nuttin else in the world
All I need is one mic... that's all a nigga need to do his thing y'know
All I need is one mic...

(Starting loud this time, getting quieter)
All I need is one life, one try, one breath I'm one man
What I stand for speaks for itself, they don't understand
Or wanna see me on top, too egotistical
Talkin' all that slick shit, the same way these bitches do
Wonder what my secrets is, niggaz'll move on you
Only if they know, what your weakness is I have none
Too late to grab guns I'm blastin 'cause I'm a cool nigga
Thought I wouldn't have that ass done? fooled you niggaz
What you call a infinite brawl, eternal souls clashin
War gets deep, some beef is everlastin
Complete with thick scars, brothers knifin each other
Up in prison yards, drama, where does it start?
You know the block was ill as a youngster
Every night it was like a, cop would get killed body found in the dumpster
For real a hustler, purchased my range, niggaz throwin' dirt on my name
Jealous cause fiends got they work and complain
Bitches left me 'cause they thought I was finished
Shoulda knew she wasn't true she came to me when her man caught a sentence
Diamonds are blindin, I never make the same mistakes
Movin with a change of pace, lighter load, see now the king is straight
Swellin my melon cause none of these niggaz real
Heard he was, tellin' police, how can a kingpin squeal?
This is crazy, I'm on the right track I'm finally found
You need some soul searchin, the time is now

All I need is one mic... yeah, yeah yeah yeah

We love you 
How many people are proud to be citizens
Of this beautiful country of ours?
The stripes and the stars for the rights that men have died for to protect
The women and men who have broke their necks for the freedom of speech 
the United States Government has sworn to uphold
Or so we are told


I never would have dreamed in a million years I'd see
So many motherfuckin' people who feel like me
Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs
It's like a fuckin' army marchin' in back of me

So many lives I've touched, so much anger aimed
at no particular direction just sprays and sprays
Straight through your radio waves it plays and plays
Till it stays stuck in your head for days and days

Who woulda thought standin' in this mirror bleachin' my hair
With some Peroxide reachin' for a T shirt to wear
That I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this?
How could I predict my words would have an impact like this

I must've struck a chord with somebody up in the office
'Cause Congress keeps tellin' me I ain't causin' nothin' but problems
And now they sayin' I'm in trouble wit the government, I'm lovin' it
I shoveled shit all my life and now I'm dumping it on

White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this 
White America, Erica loves my shit 
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get 

White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this

Look at these eyes baby blue baby just like yourself
If they were brown Shady lose Shady sits on the shelf
But Shady's cute Shady knew Shady's dimples would help
Make ladies swoon baby (Ooh baby) Look at myself

Lets do the math, if I was black I woulda sold half
I ain't have to graduate from Lincoln High School to know that
But I can rap so fuck school I'm too cool to go back
Gimme the mic show me where the fuckin' studio's at

When I was underground no one gave a fuck I was white
No labels wanted to sign me almost gave up, I was like
Fuck it until I met Dre the only one who looked past
Gave me a chance and I lit a fire up under his ass

Helped him get back to the top every fan black that I got
Was probably his in exchange for every white fan that he's got
Like damn we just swapped sittin back lookin' at shit, wow
I'm like My skin, is it startin' to work to my benefit now?

It's white America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this 
White America, Erica loves my shit 
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get 

White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this 
White America, Erica loves my shit 
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get 

See the problem is I speak to suburban kids
Who otherwise woulda never knew these words exist
Whose moms probably woulda never gave two squirts of piss
Till I created so much mutherfuckin' turbulence

Straight out the tube right into your livin' rooms I came
And kids flipped when they knew I was produced by Dre
That's all it took and they were instantly hooked right in
And they connected with me too because I looked like them

That's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope
Searchin' with a fine tooth comb its like this rope
Waitin' to choke tightenin' around my throat
Watchin' me while I write this like I don't like yes no

All I hear is: Lyrics lyrics constant controversy sponsors workin' 
'Round the clock to try to stop my concerts early surely
Hip hop was never a problem in Harlem only in Boston
After it bothered the fathers of daughters startin' to blossom

So now I'm catchin' the flack from these activists when they raggin'
Actin' like I'm the first rapper to smack a bitch and say ""faggot""
Shit, just look at me like I'm your closest pal, the poster child
The mutherfuckin' spokesman now

For white America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this 
White America, Erica loves my shit 
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get 

White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this 
White America, Erica loves my shit 
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get 

So to the parents of America
I am the derringer aimed at little Erica
To attack her character
The ring leader of the circus of worthless pawns
Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of Congress
And piss on the lawns of the White House
To burn the casket and replace it with a parental advisory sticker
To spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy
Fuck you Ms. Cheney!
Fuck you Tipper Gore!
Fuck you with the freedom of speech this divided state
Of embarrassment will allow me to have
Fuck You

Prison lobotomy, the wrong people in your head now

Jail dudes stand up, the king like a head count

I'm an animal activist, dog I'm far from a hunter
So Sarah Palin be the only cougar I put a gun to
What type of spell am I under? You want a beef? Take a number
I wonder why these younger rappers wont acknowledge their blunders
I got unquenchable hunger, my stomach rumbles like thunder
I'm real Jedi kid, you a toy Yoda like Tundra
You a scene out the movie 8 Mile, studio puncher
Run to the litter, spit a quitter bullshitter
I'm the definition of driven, the prisoners have arisen
With visions of demolition and fission through ammunition
I'm wishing cannibalism was a family tradition
I eradicate your groups over Gladiator loops, listen

If I could take your pain 
I wish that I could wash it all away 
If you only knew how I'm feeling 


Mommy, I'm sorry if my first letter made you cry 
To be honest with you, I don't think that I want to die 
Sometimes I feel like that I'm cancerous in other's lives 
That's probably why I drink at night and sleep 'til four or five 
It's kind of hard walkin' through life with my distorted eyes 
When I was younger, I was stupid and I thought I'd thrive 
I thought a lot about everything I said in the letter 
And questioned whether or not if I was dead, you'd be better 
You think my shorty would be happy if I never met her? 
It's too late now, mommy, I could never forget her 
Could never forget how she taught me to love 
'Cause my father and my grandmother is always above 
It's glory above, you know that daddy taught me to thug 
And every time we was with nanny she'd bombard me with hugs 
Damn, I miss her, mommy, and it's hard to believe 
That I'm grown and I don't understand it, why did they leave?

I got a niece, and my nephews, they need me 'round a while 
I think they need me 'cause they hittin' that age 
And they ain't tryin' to speak to Lenny 'cause they spittin' they rage 
Yeah, and mommy, speakin' to Lenny, I think my brother need me 
And we Italian, so you know my mother love to feed me 
And it's the little things you do for me that make it worth it 
Like when I play a joint that we did and you say it's perfect 
And when Jake got knocked, you knew that I was hurt 
You told me put all of my heart in the song, and it worked 
I promised him that I'd be there when he got out the bing 
You ain't raise me to be a liar, ma, that's not my thing 
I told him that I'd hold him down the whole time that he gone 
They kept him locked inside a cage, but that's cool, 'cause he's strong 
So mommy, keep that first letter I wrote you on the low 
I think I wanna stay alive and see if I can grow 


You've been running around for so long 
You've been hurting yourself too much 
You keep messing around with darkness 
You're the one who's losing

Fuck a cop, dirty pig we buckin' police

Dirt bag can't make money, he stuck in the streets

If they release me it's curtains, that's why I live in the dungeon

And hang body's that I hit up, can't fit us all

Warchild got machetes with old blood on the tip

All black UConn, shoes on everyday

Rock the bells in Hell, call me a dead ringer

Freddy Krueger sweater, rock a Beretta cocker

I'll dead a copper, head to Czechoslovakia 'fore they spot me

On security cams

When I take these young rappers and I murder they flows

Including Weezy's and Jeezy's, if I had a genie

I'd make major label rappers Ice Cube's and Eazy's

Would you capture it, or just let it slip?

Yo



His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy

There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti

He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready to drop bombs

But he keeps on forgetting what he wrote down

The whole crowd goes so loud

He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out

He's choking how, everybody's joking now

The clock's run out, time's up, over, bloah!

Snap back to reality, Oh there goes gravity

Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked

He's so mad, but he won't give up that

Easy, no

He won't have it, he knows his whole back's to these ropes

It don't matter, he's dope

He knows that but he's broke

He's so stagnant, he knows

When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's

Back to the lab again, yo

This whole rhapsody



He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him



You better lose yourself in the music, the moment

You own it, you better never let it go (go)

You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow

This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment

You own it, you better never let it go (go)

You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow



This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo

(You better)



The soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping

This world is mine for the taking

Make me king, as we move toward a new world order

A normal life is boring, but superstardom's close to post mortem

It only grows harder, homie grows hotter

He blows. It's all over. These hoes is all on him

Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter

Lonely roads, God only knows

He's grown farther from home, he's no father

He goes home and barely knows his own daughter

But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water

His hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product

They moved on to the next schmoe who flows

He nose dove and sold nada



So the soap opera is told and unfolds

I suppose it's old partner but the beat goes on

Da da dum da dum da da da da



You better lose yourself in the music, the moment

You own it, you better never let it go (go)

You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow

This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment



You own it, you better never let it go (go)

You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow

This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo

Tear this motherfucking roof off like two dogs caged

I was playing in the beginning, the mood all changed

I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage

But I kept rhyming and stepped right into the next cypher

Best believe somebody's paying the pied piper

All the pain inside amplified by the fact

That I can't get by with my 9 to 5

And I can't provide the right type of life for my family

Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers

And it's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life

And these times are so hard, and it's getting even harder

Trying to feed and water my seed, plus

Teeter totter caught up between being a father and a prima donna

Baby mama drama's screaming on her

Too much for me to wanna

Stay in one spot, another day of monotony

Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail

I've got to formulate a plot or I end up in jail or shot



Success is my only motherfucking option, failure's not

Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go

I cannot grow old in Salem's lot

Feet, fail me not, this may be the only opportunity that I got

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment

You own it, you better never let it go (go)

You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow

This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo

Back again, gain, gain
Shady's back, back, back
Tell a friend

Guess who's back, guess who's back?
Guess who's back, guess who's back?
Guess who's back, guess who's back?
Guess who's back, la, la, la

I've created a monster, 'cause nobody wants to
See Marshall no more they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor

Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
Then a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not cooperating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (hey)

You waited this long to stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating

So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me so let me see
They tried to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me

So, come on dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready, 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits, ""Fuck you Debbie""

Now this looks a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners, helpless
Till someone comes along on a mission and yells ""bitch""

A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, pollutin' the air waves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissin' my ass

And it's a disaster such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass, you ask for me?
Well I'm back - na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in and then I'm gonna enter in it

Up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kids ears and nesting

""Testing, attention please""
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my 10 cents, my 2 cents is free
A nuisance, who sent, you sent for me?

Now this looks a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

A tisk-it a task-it, I'll go tit for tat wit'
Anybody who's talking this shit, that shit
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards

And Moby, you can get stomped by Obie
You 36-year-old bald-headed fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno

Now let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol

But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me I'm just obscene (hey)

Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (hey)

There's a concept that works
20 million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'll be so empty without me

Now this looks a job for me

But you gotta search within you, you gotta find that inner strength
And just pull that shit out of you and get that motivation to not give up
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse.

Yo left, yo left, yo left right left
Yo left, yo left, yo left right left
Yo left, yo left, yo left right left
Yo left, yo left, yo left right left

Till I collapse I’m spilling these raps long as you feel 'em
Till the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killing them
'Cause when I am not then I'ma stop penning 'em
And I am not hip-hop and I’m just not Eminem.
Subliminal thoughts when I'm stop sending them women are caught in webs spin and hauk venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illing to stop.
Amoxacilin is just not real enough.
The criminal cop killing hip-hop filling a minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners.
You're coming with me, feel it or not you’re gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of god lives in us.
You hear it a lot, lyrics that shock is it a miracle or am I just a product of pop fizzing up.
For sizzle my whizzle this is the plot listen up you bizzles forgot slizzle does not give a fuck.

Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps.
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps.
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.

Music is like magic there’s a certain feeling you get when you're real
And you spit and people are feeling your shit.
This is your moment and every single minute you spend trying to hold onto it
'cause you may never get it again.
So while you’re in it try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over just admit when it's at its end.
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half this shit that gets in.
I got a list here's the order of my list that it's in.
It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie, Andre from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me.
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy, so when I’m not put on this list the shit does not offend me.
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's bothering me.
Even though half you people got a fucking problem with me.
You hate it but you know respect you've got to give me
The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney. Nate hit me.

Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps.
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps.
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.

Soon as a verse starts I eat it at MC’s heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me? Smart.
And it's absurd how people hang on every word.
I’ll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I’ll never be served my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave earth that would be the death of me first.
'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse.
That’s why I’m clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I’m an addict
I rap like I’m addicted to smack like I’m Kim Mathers.
But I don’t want to go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers.
So this is like a full blown attack I’m launching at them
The track is on some battling raps who want some static
'Cause I don’t really think that the fact that I’m Slim matters
A plaque of platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest.

Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps.
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps.
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.

Until the roof (Until the roof)
The roof comes off (The roof comes off)
Until my legs (Until my legs)
Give out from underneath me (Give out form underneath me)

Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence ready to pick it
But quick get impaled when I tell 'em stick it
So sick I'm looking pale, well that's my pigment

With the ugly Kardashian

Bars hard, drugs hard thought that's the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock future into tomorrow
And girl I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am tryin' to find a way to get you alone, car note

Oh, Marshall Mathers shouldn’t everybody know
Get the bar soap lathered, came ghost and called Arthur’s Cargo's
Girl you’re fixin' to get your heart broke, don’t be absurd man

Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know

Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is
Find different ways to word the same old song
Ever since I came along
From the day the song called ""Hi! My Name Is"" dropped
Started thinkin' my name was Fault
'Cause anytime things went wrong
I was the one who they would blame it on

The media made me the equivalent of a modern-day Genghis Khan
Tried to argue it was only entertainment, dog
Gangsta? Nah, courageous balls
Had to change my style, they said I'm way too soft
And I sound like AZ and Nas, out came the claws
And the fangs been out since then
But up until the instant that I went against it

It was ingrained in me
That I wouldn't amount to a shit stain I thought
No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught
Do I really belong in this game? I pondered
I just wanna play my part
Should I make waves or not?
So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on

And I don't wanna seem ungrateful
Or disrespect the art form I was raised upon
But sometimes you gotta take a loss and have people rub it in your face
Before you get made pissed off
And keep pluggin', it's your only outlet, and your only outfit
So you know they gonna talk about it
Better find a way to counter it, quick and make it, ah

Feel like I've already said this a kabillion eighty times
How many times can I say the same thing different ways that rhyme?
What I really wanna say is, if there's anyone else that can relate to my story?
Bet you feel the same way I felt when I was in the same place you are
When I was afraid to...


I was a-afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I would never find a way ou-ou-out
Afraid I'd never be found
I don't wanna go another round

An angry man's power will shut you up
Tripwires fill this house with tiptoed love
Run out of excuses for everyone
So here I am and I will not run

Guts over fear  
Guts over fear 
For all the times I let you push me around, I let you keep me down
 Guts over fear, guts over fear


Feels like a close, it's coming to
Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know

I know what it's like I was there once
Single parents, hate your appearance
Did you struggle to find your place in this world?
And the pain spawns all the anger on
But it wasn't until I put the pain in song
Learned who to aim it on that I made a spark
Started to spit hard as shit
Learned how to harness it while the reins were off

And there was a lot of bizarre shit, but the crazy part
Was soon as I stopped saying ""I gave a fuck""
Haters started to appreciate my art
And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I caused
But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone
And the lights go out in that trailer park?

And the window is closin' and there's nowhere else that I can go
With flows and I'm frozen
'Cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from
Just a bunch of playful songs that I made for fun
So to the break of dawn here I go recycling the same old song
But I'd rather make ""Not Afraid 2""
Than make another motherfuckin' ""We Made You"", uh

And I don't wanna seem indulgent
When I discuss my lows and my highs
My demise and my uprise, pray to God
I just open enough eyes later on
Gave you the supplies and the tools
To hopefully use that'll make you strong
Enough to lift yourself up, when you feel like I felt
'Cause I can't explain to y'all

How dang exhausted my legs felt
Just having to balance my dang self
When on eggshells I was made to walk
But thank you Ma, 'cause that gave me the
Strength to 'cause Shady-mania
So when they empty that stadium
'Least I made it out of that house
And found a place in this world when the day was done

So this is for every kid who all's they ever did
Was dreamt of one day just gettin' accepted
I represent him or her, anyone similar
You are the reason that I made this song
And everything you're scared to say
Don't be afraid to say no more
From this day forward just let them a-holes talk
Take it with a grain of salt
And eat their fuckin' faces off

The legend of the angry blonde lives on
Through you when I'm gone

You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper, before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words, before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem

What you think, I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world feed it beans

And all those who looked down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony

From  down to the last  album, he's still shittin'
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him

Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a ""fuck you"" for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the earth, he's got the urge
To pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole universe

I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm, for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth, for that
Fuck your feelin's, instead of gettin' crowned you're gettin' capped

And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact
Let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was eh
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground

Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack-bloww
'Cause I ain't playin' around, there's a game called circle
And I don't know how, I'm way too up to back down

But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud
Still follows me around, but it's time to exorcise these demons
These motherfuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now

And drop dead, no more beef flingers

No more drama from now on, I promise
To focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof, like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it

Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up

Jealous when I spend time with the girls, why I'm married to you
Still man I don't know, but tonight I'm serving you with papers
I'm divorcin' you, go marry someone else and make 'em famous

And take away their freedom, like you did to me, treat 'em
Like you don't need 'em and they ain't worthy of you, feed 'em
The same shit that you made me eat, I'm movin' on forget you
Oh, now I'm special, I ain't feel special when I was with you

All I ever felt was dissed, helplessness, imprisoned by a selfish bitch
Chew me up and spit me out, I fell for this so many times, it's ridiculous
And still I stick with this, I'm sick of this
But in my sickness and addiction, you're addictive as they get

Evil as they come, vindictive as they make 'em
My friends keep askin' me, why I can't just walk away from 'em
I'm addicted to the pain the stress the drama, I'm drawn to shit
I guess I'm a mess, cursed and blessed

But this time I ain't changin' my mind, I'm climbin' out this abyss
You're screamin' as I walk out that I'll be missed
But when you spoke of people who meant the most to you, you left me off your list
Fuck you hip-hop, I'm leaving you, my life sentence is served bitch

And it's just
Too late for the other side

You just hurt my goddamn feeling and that was the last one I had

See the silhouette of a stalker in your walkway, better cooperate

Or get sauteed and rotisseried, while you're hog-tied
MC's get so quiet, you can hear a mo'fuckin' dog whistle when I walk by
Colt Seavers on a mule, stuntin' on that ass like the fuckin' Fall Guy
I don't gas my Mercedes after midnight, I treat it like a mogwai

'Cause it will turn into a gremlin and run over kids women and men
Vnnn-vnnn motor's so big, you can fit a midget in his engine
Bitch, give me them digits, why you cringin', not by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin
Will I spend spend even ten cents on you since when

Do you think it's gonna cost me a pretty penny
Shit, if I think a penny's pretty, just imagine how beautiful a quarter is to me
Eenie-meenie-miney-mo, catch an Eskimo by his toe, while he's trying to roll a snowball
But don't make him lose his cool, if he hollers better let him go ya'll

'Cause...

Now here we go, go, go

Get up baby get a move on, like a U-Haul, you can rack your brain like pool balls
You won't ever think of this shit, yeah honey you called?
Well here I come, Havoc on the beat, I wreak it, evil I see hear and speak it

Put your eggs in the same basket, you can count every mo'fuckin' chicken 'fore it hatches
'Cause, you can bet your ass that we gon' get it crackin'
Like the Kraken and Titans when they're clashin', get your brains bashed in
So bad you gon' have Kurt Cobain askin' to autograph a bloodstained napkin

Unfashionable and 'bout as rational as a rash on a fag's asshole
Now let's take that line run it up the flag pole with

Now look you little slut cunt whore, I know you want more
Bitch it's time to put the math back in the Mathers, 'cause I'm a fuckin' problem, run boy

Every flow got it mastered, so every last word that you fuckin' fags heard
Comes straight from the fishes ass, yeah in other words I'm a bass-turd
Lookin' at me like I killed Kenny, gas in the tank yeah still plenty
No morals are instilled in me, so remorse I really don't feel any

Tell me where to go, tell me what to do
I'll be right there for you
Tell me what to say, no matter if it's true
I'll say it all for you

:
I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
Why am I so differently wired? Am I a martian?
What kind of twisted experiment am I involved in?
'Cause I don't belong in this world that’s why I'm scoffing

At authority, defiant often, flying off at
The handle at my mom, no dad, So I’m non-com-
-pliant at home, at school I’m just shy and awkward
And I don’t need no goddamn psychologist

Tryna diagnose why I have all these underlying problems
Thinking he can try and solve 'em
I'm outside chalking up drawings on the sidewalk
And in the front drive talking to myself

Either that or inside hiding off in
The corner somewhere quiet, trying not to be noticed 'cause I'm crying and sobbing
I had a bad day at school so I ain't talking
Some cocksucker shoved me into a fucking locker 'cause he said that I eyeballed him

:
And if you fall, I'll get you there
I'll be your savior from
All the wars that are fought inside your world
Please have faith in my words

'Cause this is my legacy, legacy, eh
This is my legacy, legacy, eh
There’s no guarantee, it’s not up to me, you can only see
This is my legacy, legacy
Legacy, legacy

:
I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
Why am I so differently wired in my noggin
'Cause sporadic as my thoughts come, it's mind boggling
'Cause I obsess on everything, in my mind small shit

Bothers me, but not my father, he said sayonara
Then split, but I don’t give a shit I'm fine long as
There's batteries in my Walkman nothing is the matter with me
Shit look on the bright side, at least I ain't walking

I bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment
Complex on a ten speed which I've acquired parts
That I find in the garbage, a frame then put tires on it
Headphones on, look straight ahead if kids try an' start shit

But if this is all there is for me life offers
Why bother even try and put up a fight, it's nonsense
But I think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience
What about them rhymes I've been jottin' they're kinda giving me confidence

Instead of tryin' to escape through my comics
Why don't I just blast a little something like Onyx?
To put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that
Say what I wanna say to that kid that said that I eyeballed him

Grab hold of my balls like that's right fight's on bitch
Who woulda knew from the moment I turned the mic on that
I could be iconic in my conquest
That's word to Phife Dawg from A Tribe Called Quest

:
This is my legacy, legacy, eh
This is my legacy, legacy, eh
There’s no guarantee, it’s not up to me, you can only see
This is my legacy, legacy
Legacy, legacy

:
I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
Now I think the fact that I'm differently wired's awesome
'Cause if I wasn't I wouldn't be able to work
Words like this and connect lines like crosswords

And use my enemy's words as strength
To try and draw from, and get inspired off 'em
'Cause all my life I was told and taught I am not shit
By you whack fucking giant sacks of lying dog shit

Now you shut up bitch, I am talking
Thought I was full of horseshit and now you fucking worship the ground on which I am walking
Me against the world so what, I'm Brian Dawkins
Versus the whole 0 and 16 Lions' offense

So bring on the Giants, Falcons, and Miami Dolphins
It's the body bag game, bitch I'm supplying coffins
'Cause you dicks butt-kiss, a bunch of Brian Baldingers
You gon' die a ball-licker

I've been diabolical with this dialogue since '99 Rawkus
You don't respect the legacy I leave behind y'all can
Suck a dick, the day you beat me pigs'll fly out my ass
In a flying saucer full of Italian sausage

The most high exalting and I ain't halting
Till I die of exhaustion, inhale my exhaust fumes
The best part about me is I am not you
I'm me, and I'm the fire marshal and

Something's wrong, I can feel it (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)
Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble – big trouble
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances
You are just what the doc ordered

I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slapbox, slapbox?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rapbot

But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit

Made a living and a killing off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nut-sack
I'm an MC still as honest

But as rude and indecent as all hell
Syllables skill-a-holic 
This slickety-gippety-hippity-hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissing match with this rappity-rap
Packing a MAC in the back of the Ac, backpack rap, yap-yap, yacketty-yack

And now at the exact same time
I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half

Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs, feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are having a rough time period, here's a maxi-pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece, yeah

'Cause I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slapbox, slapbox?
Let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard

Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the earth like an asteroid, I did nothing but shoot for the moon since
*pew*

MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to bust a rhyme
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N-
-W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren, Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim

Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up, and be in a position
To meet Run-D.M.C. and induct them into the motherfuckin' Rock n'
Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game till I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinking?
Little gay looking boy

So gay I can barely say it with a straight face looking boy
You witnessing a massacre
Like you watching a church gathering take place looking boy
Oy vey, that boy's gay, that's all they say looking boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a way to go from your label everyday looking boy
Hey, looking boy, what you say looking boy?
I get a ""hell yeah"" from Dre looking boy
I'mma work for everything I have
Never asked nobody for shit, get out my face looking boy
Basically boy you're never gonna be capable
Of keeping up with the same pace looking boy

'Cause I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racing around the track, call me Nascar, Nascar
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton, no Asgard, Asgard

So you be Thor and I'll be Odin, you rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off then I'm reloading immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walking dead, but I'm just a talking head, a zombie floating
But I got your mom deep throating

I'm out my Ramen noodle, we have nothing in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though

For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle
Enough rhymes to maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground, but I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind

So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come trying to censor you
Like that one line I said on ""I'm Back"" from The Mathers LP
One where I tried to say I'd take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm

Morphin' into an immortal coming through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking cornrows
You write normal, fuck being normal
And I just bought a new raygun from the future

To just come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Maywhether’s pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh, man, that was the 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day
""Hey, Fab, I'mma kill you""
Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed, JJ Fad

Uh, sama lamaa duma lamaa you assuming I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber
So that anything you say is ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
Oh, he's too mainstream
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
It's not hip-hop, it's pop, 'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on Lose Yourself and make 'em lose it

I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I’m ripping any one of these verses diverse as you
It’s curtains, I’m inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to prove
That if you were half as nice, your songs and you could sacrifice virgins too

School flunky, pill junky
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you, ill when I speak in tongues
But it's still tongue and cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel, I'm asleep in the front seat
Bumping Heavy D. & The Boyz, still chunky, but funky
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me

They asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I had
Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation
Understand the discrimination

But fuck it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then
But if I can't batter the women how the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
Don't mistake it for Satan
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas
And take a vacation to trip a broad
And make her fall on her face and don't be a retard
Be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a God?",angry, Rap God,XbGs_qK2PQA

Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing

To see him walking around with his headphones blaring
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care
He's a problem child and what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out

'Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
But if he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are whacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap

He sags his pants, do-rags and a stocking cap
His stepfather hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose, his house is a broken home
There's no control, he just lets his emotions go


 Sing with me,  for the year 
For the laughter, sing for the tear 
Sing it with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangstas
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely 'cause don't anyone know me

Yet everybody just feels like they can relate
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great
Or they can degrade, or even worse they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make

Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass

But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad

So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly

But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously
So I'm signin' CDs while police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense B

It's all political, if my music is literal
And I'm a criminal how the fuck can I raise a little girl
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you

 Sing with me, (Sing!) for the year (Sing that shit!)
For the laughter, sing for the tears (Sing with me!)
Sing it with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well can it load a gun up for you and cock it too
Well if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued

See what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
And they want to get one 'cause they think the shit's cool
Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves, we entertainers
Of course the shit's affectin' our sales, you ignoramus

But music is reflection of self, we just explain it
And then we get our checks in the mail, it's fucked up ain't it
How we can come from practically nothing
To being able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted

That's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing
Except for a dream, and a fuckin' rap magazine
Who post pin-up pictures on their walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs

Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
Till they sit and they cry at night, wishin' they'd die
Till they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
We're nothin' to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes

That's why we, seize the moment try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it, 'cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone just let our spirits live on
Through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can

Sing with me,  for the year

Even if it means goin' toe to toe with a  it don't matter

I'd never drag them in battles that I can handle unless I absolutely have to 
I'm supposed to set an example 
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em 
If some shit ever just pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em

There's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it 
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it 
It was crazy, this shit be way beyond some  and  shit 

And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
I spent too much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted 
And I'm so caught in it I almost feel I'm the one who caused it 
This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it 

That was never my object for someone to get killed 
Why would I wanna destroy something I helped build?
It wasn't my intentions, my intentions was good 
I went through my whole career without ever mentionin' it

Now it's just out of respect for not runnin' my mouth 
And talkin' about something that I knew nothing about
Plus  told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef 
So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth 

While he's all over TV down talkin' a man
Who literally saved my life, like ""Fuck it, I understand""
This is business and this shit just isn't none of my business
But still knowin' this shit could pop off at any minute 'cause

And wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin' 
But now it's elevated 'cause once you put someone's kids in it 
The shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more is it?

It's a different ball game, callin' names and you ain't just rappin' 
We actually tried to stop the  and Ja beef from happenin' 
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it he wasn't gonna go after him

Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how we stabbed him
Fuck it 50 smash 'em, mash 'em, and let him have it 
Meanwhile my attention is pulled in another direction
Some receptionist at  who answers phones at his desk

Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record 
But now he's fucked the game up 'cause one of the ways I came up 
Was through that publication, the same one that made me famous

Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin' 
Well fuck it, that mutherfucker can get it too, fuck him then
When I'm so busy being pissed off I don't stop to think 
That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc. 

And he's inherited mine which is fine ain't like either of us mind 
We still have soldiers that's on the front line
That's willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders
Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us

We'll maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus 
To show them we love 'em back and let 'em know how important it is 
To have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is

But I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt or murdered 
It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it 
Than to just say that I love ya'll too much to see the verdict
I'll walk away from it all before I let it go any further 

But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin' 
I'm just willin' to be the bigger man if y'all can quit poppin'

So they say you're best to go your separate ways, guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over

But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again, now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane

:
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

:
Now I know we said things, did things, that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
But when it comes to love, you're just as blinded, baby please

Come back, it wasn't you, baby it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though

Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the dry wall

Next time, there will be no next time, I apologize
Even though I know it's lies, I'm tired of the games
I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire

:
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry

My own words I guess

Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for
When they know they're your heart
And you know you were their armor

And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm 'em
But what happens when karma turns right around and bites you
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of a pain?
""Daddy, look what I made."", dad's gotta go catch a plane

""Daddy, where's mommy? I can't find mommy, where is she?""
I don't know go play Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
Daddy's writing this song, this song ain't gonna write itself
I'll give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself

Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-bye baby

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back

I keep having this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screaming, she don't want me to sing
""You're making mommy cry, why? Why is mommy crying?""
Baby, daddy ain't leaving no more, ""Daddy you're lying,
You always say that, you always say this is the last time.
But you ain't leaving no more, daddy you're mine.""

She's pilling boxes in front of the door trying to block it
""Daddy please, daddy don't leave, daddy - no stop it!""
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, ""This'll keep you safe daddy, take it with ya.""

I look up, it's just me standing in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talking, 'cause man I can hear 'em
They're saying ""You've got one more chance to do right,"" and it's tonight
Now go out there and show that you love 'em before it's too late
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone, and this spotlight is on
And I'm singing

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back

60,000 people, all jumping out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwing roses at my feet
I take a bow and thank you all for coming out
They're screaming so loud, I take one last look at the crowd

I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seeing
""Daddy it's me, help mommy, her wrists are bleeding,""
But baby we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?
""I followed you daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'

""You lied to me Dad, and now you make mommy sad
And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'.
That's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin.
I get the point - fine, me and mommy are gone.""

But baby wait, ""It's too late dad, you made the choice.
Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us.""
That's what they want, they want you Marshall, they keep screamin' your name
It's no wonder you can't go to sleep, just take another pill
Yeah, I bet you you will. You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real

I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be, that the curtain is closing on me
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain and scream ""Die Shady!"" and pop it

The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
It's Spring and Hailie's outside swinging, I walk right up to Kim and kiss her
Tell her I miss her, Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister
Almost as if to say

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn

This one's for you and me, livin' out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
Lift my arms out wide, I open my eyes, and now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters, a sky full of lighters

:
By the time you hear this I will have already spiraled up
I would never do nothing to let you cowards fuck my world up
If I was you, I would duck, or get struck like lightning
Fighters keep fighting, put your lighters up, point em' skyward, uh

Had a dream I was king, I woke up, still king
This rap game's nipple is mine for the milking
Till nobody else even fucking feels me, till it kills me
I swear to God I'll be the fucking illest in this music

There is or there ever will be, disagree
Feel free, but from now on I'm refusing to ever give up
The only thing I ever gave up's using, no more excuses
Excuse me if my head is too big for this building

And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick, but you cocks are slick
Poppin' shit on how you flipped ya life around, crock-o-shit
Who you dicks try to kid, flipped dick, you did the opposite
You stayed the same, 'cause cock backwards is still cock, you pricks

I love it when I tell 'em shove it 'cause it wasn't that
Long ago when Marshall sat, luster lacked, flustered
'Cause he couldn't cut mustard, muster up nothing
Brain fuzzy, 'cause he's buzzin', woke up from that buzz, and now you wonder

Why he does it, how he does it, wasn't 'cause he had buzzards circle around his head
Waiting for him to drop dead, was it
Or was it 'cause them bitches wrote him off
Little hussy ass, 'cause fuck, guess it doesn't matter now, does it

What difference it make, what's it take, to get it through your thick skulls
If this ain't, some bullshit people don't usually come back this way
From a place that was dark as I was in just to get to this place
Now let these words be like a switch blade to a hater's rib cage

And let it be known from this day forward
I wanna just say thanks 'cause your hate is what gave me the strength
So let 'em Bics raise 'cause I came with 5'9"" but I feel like I'm 6'8""

By the time you hear this I'll probably already be outtie
I advance like going from toting iron to going and
Buying 4 or 5 of the homies the iron man Audi
My daddy told me ""Slow down, boy, you going to blow it""

And I ain't gotta stop the beat a minute
To tell Shady I love him the same way that he did Dr. Dre on 
Tell him how real he is or how high I am
Or how I would kill for him to know it

I cried plenty tears, my daddy got a bad back
So it's only right that I right
Till he can march right into that post office and tell 'em to hang it up
Now his career's Lebron's jersey in 20 years

I'll stop when I'm at the very top
You shitted on me on your way up, it's 'bout to be a scary drop
'Cause what goes up must come down
You going down on something you don't wanna see, like a hairy box

Every hour, happy hour now, life is wacky now
Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy
Now I'm just the cats meow, ow
Classic cow, always down for the catch weight like Pacquiao

Y'all are doomed, I remember when T-Pain ain't wanna work with me
My car starts itself, parks itself, and autotunes
'Cause now I'm in the Aston, I went from having my city locked up
To getting treated like Kwame Kilpatrick

And now I'm fantastic, compared to a weed high
And y'all niggas just gossipin' like bitches on a radio and TV
See me, we fly
Y'all buggin' out like Wendy Williams staring at a beehive

And how real is that
I remember signing my first deal
And now I'm the second best, I can deal with that
Now Bruno can show his ass, without the MTV Awards gag

:
You and I know what it's like
To be kicked down, forced to fight
But tonight we're all right
So hold up your lights
Let it shine

Close your eyes, as we witness another bullet ride

Do you know that everybody's gone?
Do you know that you're on your own?

Has left me wrestling with our disparity
Leave me alone, take another wretched soul on the hellride
Go find a more susceptible sucker

But you gotta search within you, you gotta find that inner strength
And just pull that shit out of you and get that motivation to not give up
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse.

Yo left, yo left, yo left right left
Yo left, yo left, yo left right left
Yo left, yo left, yo left right left
Yo left, yo left, yo left right left

Till I collapse I’m spilling these raps long as you feel 'em
Till the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killing them
'Cause when I am not then I'ma stop penning 'em
And I am not hip-hop and I’m just not Eminem.
Subliminal thoughts when I'm stop sending them women are caught in webs spin and hauk venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illing to stop.
Amoxacilin is just not real enough.
The criminal cop killing hip-hop filling a minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners.
You're coming with me, feel it or not you’re gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of god lives in us.
You hear it a lot, lyrics that shock is it a miracle or am I just a product of pop fizzing up.
For sizzle my whizzle this is the plot listen up you bizzles forgot slizzle does not give a fuck.

Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps.
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps.
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.

Music is like magic there’s a certain feeling you get when you're real
And you spit and people are feeling your shit.
This is your moment and every single minute you spend trying to hold onto it
'cause you may never get it again.
So while you’re in it try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over just admit when it's at its end.
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half this shit that gets in.
I got a list here's the order of my list that it's in.
It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie, Andre from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me.
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy, so when I’m not put on this list the shit does not offend me.
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's bothering me.
Even though half you people got a fucking problem with me.
You hate it but you know respect you've got to give me
The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney. Nate hit me.

Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps.
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps.
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.

Soon as a verse starts I eat it at MC’s heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me? Smart.
And it's absurd how people hang on every word.
I’ll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I’ll never be served my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave earth that would be the death of me first.
'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse.
That’s why I’m clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I’m an addict
I rap like I’m addicted to smack like I’m Kim Mathers.
But I don’t want to go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers.
So this is like a full blown attack I’m launching at them
The track is on some battling raps who want some static
'Cause I don’t really think that the fact that I’m Slim matters
A plaque of platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest.

Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps.
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps.
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.

Would you capture it, or just let it slip?

Yo



His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy

There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti

He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready to drop bombs

But he keeps on forgetting what he wrote down

The whole crowd goes so loud

He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out

He's choking how, everybody's joking now

The clock's run out, time's up, over, bloah!

Snap back to reality, Oh there goes gravity

Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked

He's so mad, but he won't give up that

Easy, no

He won't have it, he knows his whole back's to these ropes

It don't matter, he's dope

He knows that but he's broke

He's so stagnant, he knows

When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's

Back to the lab again, yo

This whole rhapsody



He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him



You better lose yourself in the music, the moment

You own it, you better never let it go (go)

You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow

This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment

You own it, you better never let it go (go)

You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow



This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo

The soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping

This world is mine for the taking

Make me king, as we move toward a new world order

A normal life is boring, but superstardom's close to post mortem

It only grows harder, homie grows hotter

He blows. It's all over. These hoes is all on him

Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter

Lonely roads, God only knows

He's grown farther from home, he's no father

He goes home and barely knows his own daughter

But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water

His hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product

They moved on to the next schmoe who flows

He nose dove and sold nada



So the soap opera is told and unfolds

I suppose it's old partner but the beat goes on

Da da dum da dum da da da da



You better lose yourself in the music, the moment

You own it, you better never let it go (go)

You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow

No more games, I'm a change what you call rage

Tear this motherfucking roof off like two dogs caged

I was playing in the beginning, the mood all changed

I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage

But I kept rhyming and stepped right into the next cypher

Best believe somebody's paying the pied piper

All the pain inside amplified by the fact

That I can't get by with my 9 to 5

And I can't provide the right type of life for my family

Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers

And it's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life

And these times are so hard, and it's getting even harder

Trying to feed and water my seed, plus

Teeter totter caught up between being a father and a prima donna

Baby mama drama's screaming on her

Too much for me to wanna

Stay in one spot, another day of monotony

Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail

I've got to formulate a plot or I end up in jail or shot



Success is my only motherfucking option, failure's not

Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go

I cannot grow old in Salem's lot

So here I go it's my shot.

Feet, fail me not, this may be the only opportunity that I got

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment

You own it, you better never let it go (go)

You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow

I want this shit forever, mine (ever mine, ever mine)

And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever, mine (ever mine, ever mine)

There they go, packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, Macadamian, they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like bozos, he's wonderin' if he should spit this slow
Fuck no, go for broke, his cup just runneth over, oh, no
He ain't had a real buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed
They been waitin' patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know rap'll never be the same as before
Bashin' in the brains of these hoes, and establishin' a name as he goes
The passion and the flame is ignited, you can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck that I'm talkin' about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains who stand inside of the booth truth spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings come flyin' up out of our mouths, now rewind it
Payback, motherfucker, for the way that you got at me, how's it taste,
When I slap the taste out of your mouths with the bass so loud that it shakes the place?
I'm Hannibal Lector, so just in case you're thinkin' of saving face
You ain't gonna have no face to save by the time I'm through with this place, so Drake

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

:
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe but I still fight, while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight

High off her love, drunk from her hate, it's like I'm huffin' paint
And I love her the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates
Me, she fucking hates me and I love it, wait

Where you going, I'm leaving you, no you ain't
Come back, we're running right back here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's going good it's going great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane

But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped ""who's that dude?"", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

:
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry

You ever love somebody so much, you can barely breathe when you're with 'em
You meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah them chills used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em

You'd swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em
Now you're in each others' face, spewing venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push pull each others' hair, scratch claw bit 'em
Throw 'em down pin 'em, so lost in them moments when you're in 'em

It's the rage that took over, it controls ya both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways, guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over

But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again, now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane

:
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

:
Now I know we said things, did things, that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
But when it comes to love, you're just as blinded, baby please

Come back, it wasn't you, baby it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though

Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the dry wall

Next time, there will be no next time, I apologize
Even though I know it's lies, I'm tired of the games
I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire

Go ahead fuckin' hater push me, I told you ain't no fuckin' way to shush me

Man the fuck up sissy, G's up, all you gardeners freeze up
Put your hoes down, , naw I can't goddammit, rap is a landfill
Drop the anvil, these are shoes that you can't fill

You know the one thing I noticed about critics, man
Is critics never asked me how my day went

Yesterday my dog died, I hog tied a ho, tied her in a bow
Said next time you blog, try to spit a flow
You wanna criticize dog, try a little mo'
I'm so tired of this, I could blow, fire in the hole

I'm fired up so fire up the lighter and the dro
Better hold on a little tighter, here I go
Flow's tighter, hot headed as ghost rider, cold hearted
As  throwin' a spider in the snow

So you better get lower than  inside of a low-rider
With no tires in the hole
Why am I like this, why is winter cold
Why is it when I talk, I'm so biased to the ho's

Listen dog, Christmas is off, this is as soft as it gets
This isn't golf, this is a blisterin' assault
Those are your wounds, this is the salt
So get lost, shit, dissin' me is just like pissin' off

, wrap a lizard in gauze
Beat you in the jaws with it, grab the scissors and saws
And cut out your livers, gizzards and balls
Throw you in the middle of the ocean in a blizzard with Jaws

So sip piss like sizzurp through a straw
Then describe how it tasted like dessert to us all
Got the gall to make Chris piss in his drawers
Tickle him, go to his grave, skip him and visit his dog

Hogan and David Cook, that the crook just took over, so book

Run as fast as you can, stop writing and kill it
I'm lightnin' in a skillet, you're a fuckin' flash in the pan
I pop up, you bitches scatter
Like hot grease splashin' a fan, Mr. Mathers is the man

Yeah, I'm pissed but I would rather take this energy and stash it in a can
Come back and whip your ass with it again
Saliva's like sulfuric acid in your hand
It'll eat through anything, metal, the ass of Iron Man

Turn him into plastic, so for you to think that you could stand
A fuckin' chance is asinine, yeah ask Denaun, man
Hit a blind man with a coloring book and told him color inside the lines
Or get hit with a flying crayon

Fuck it, I ain't playin'
Pull up in a van and hop out on a homeless man holdin' a sign sayin'
Vietnam Vet, I'm out my fuckin' mind, man
Kick over the can, beat his ass and leave him nine grand

We just posted, getting crazy, living like this is so amazing
Hold up, take a step back when we roll up, 'cause I know what
We been loyal, we been fam, we the ones you trust in
Won't hesitate to go straight to your head like a concussion

See, I'm a fool for pain, I'm a dummy

Might cut my head off right after I slit my throat
Tongue kiss a shark, got jealous bitches up in the boat
Eating peanut butter and jellyfishes on toast
And if I get stung, I get stoked, might choke

Like I chewed a chunk of charcoal, naked in the North Pole
That's why my heart cold, full of sorrow, the lost soul
And only Lord knows when I'm coming to the crossroads
So I don't fear shit but tomorrow

And I'm a sucker for pain, it ain't nothing but pain
You just fuckin' complain, you ain't tough as you claim
Just stay up in your lane, just don't fuck with Lil Wayne
I'm a jump from a plane or stand in front of a train

'Cause I'm a sucker for pain

Used to doing bad, now we feel like we just now getting it
Ain't got no other way so we started and finished it

No pain, no gain
Never stand down, made our own way
Never going slow, we pick up the pace
This is what we wanted from a young age

No emotion, that's what business is
Lord have mercy on the witnesses

On the border line

Of the edge and where I walk alone

Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough

No you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done

But I don't wanna live that way

You said that you could let it go

We're all rolling down the boulevard, full of pimps and sharks
It's a motherfucking riot, we've been dying to start
You better grab a hold, 'cause now you know you're falling apart
You thought these streets were paved in gold, but they're dirty and dark

At the bottom of the hill, but at the top of the street
Above the boulevard, schoolyard, victim of deceit
And you're running hard, but this wolf is always at your feet
Yeah, you've seen it all before, but the wolf's outside your door
And you're old enough to run, you ain't hiding anymore
Another victim of the star spangled banner of the street
Now you're in the world of wolves, and we welcome all you sheep

You need to wake up and face it, so you can taste my reality
Now you're stuck in this place you hate, and you came here so happily
Then it made you lose your faith, and that's what fucked with your sanity
Say goodbye to your soul and say hello to your vanity
Hollywood is your friend, and the undead are your family
We'll take you to the edge, and turn your regret in to agony
And I'll never let you go, 'cause I know you'll come back to me
I'm the reason you came here, I'm the American tragedy

A gift to cherish until piece by piece
You laid before the roots of time
Day by day the nights swallow
Sun, and with every night
The more you gave your sadness came undone
You just kept slipping through the cracks
Of my fingertips

I only hope that you remember me
As the one from the trees
When the forests used to sing
Or when I locked myself
In the heart of the wood
And threw away key

Sharing your stories with the moon and the threes
With a world which strung you along
I've shut you out

I do not stay at the Intercontinental
And anything I got is not a rental, I own that mothafucka
Figured out this shit, it's simple
My stock been going up like a crescendo
A bunch of handshakes from the fakes
But nigga I do not want to be friends though
I told y'all mothafuckas, man, this shit is not a love song
This a fuck a stripper on a mink rug song
This a fuck them boys forever, hold a grudge song
Pop some fucking champagne in the tub song, nigga, ""just because"" song

What's the move? Can I tell the truth?
If I was doing this for you then I'd have nothing left to prove
Nah, this for me, though
I'm just trynna stay alive and take care of my people
And they don't have no award for that, trophies, trophies
And they don't have no award for that
Shit don't come with trophies, ain't no envelopes to open
I just do it 'cause I'm 'sposed to, nigga

Bitch I go to Dreams with a suitcase
I got my whole country on a new wave
She like, ""I heard all your niggas stay where you stay""
House so big I haven't seen them boys in two days
Bitch, I use a walkie talkie just to get a beverage
I saw my parents split up right after the wedding
That taught my ass to stay committed, fuck the credit
Bitch check the numbers, I'm the one who really get it
I told y'all mothafuckas, man, this shit is not a love song
This a doing me and only God can judge song
I do not know what the fuck you thought it was song
Pop some fucking champagne in the tub song, nigga, ""just because"" song

What's the move? Can I tell the truth?
If I was doing this for you then I'd have nothing left to prove

This kind of music, use it, and you get amped to do shit
Whenever you hear some shit and you can't refuse it
It's just some shit, for these kids, to trash they rooms with
Just refuse whenever they asked to do shit
The type of shit that you don't have to ask who produced it
You just know - that's the new shit
The type of shit that causes mass confusion
And drastic movement of people acting stupid

(Verse 1: Kon Artis)
I come to every club with intention to do harm
With a prosthetic arm and smelling like Boone's Farm
Hiding under tables as soon as I hear alarms
Paranoid thief that'll steal from his own mom
Kuniving Kon, artist with a bomb
Strapped to my stomach screaming, ""Let's get it on!""
A lush that love to drink, drunk driving a tank
Rollin' over a bank, cops see me and faint
It's drastic, I'm past my limit of coke
I think I'll up my high by slitting your throat
Push your baby carriage into the street, till it's mince meat
Your mens been beat the minute I step onto your street
This is fight music!

(Verse 2: Bizarre)
You know why my hands are so numb? (No)
Cause my grandmother sucked my dick and I didn't cum (oh)
Smacked this whore for talking crap (bitch)
So what if she's handicapped, the bitch said Bizarre couldn't rap!
I fucking hate you; I'll take your drawers down and rape you
While Dr. Dre videotapes you (hell yeah!)
Satan done got me on this song
Eating a hot dog reading the Holy Qu'ran, while I'm on the john
Tired of wearing this yellow thong
Take it back Sisqo, you know where it belongs (thong th-thong thong)
Now here's a gun, I'll put it in your palm
Now go over there and blow up Dru Hill's arms
Fuck your love songs!

(Verse 3: Proof)
Just bring who you gon' bring on, who you gon' swing on?
I'm King Kong, guns blow you to kingdom come
Show you machine gun funk
Sixteen m-16's and one pump
The snub in my paw, shove it in your jaws
Have you running out this fucking club in your drawers
We loving the broads, there's nothing to applaud
But fuck it it's all good, the hood is up in us all
It's fight music!

(Verse 4: Swifty McVay)
I'm a nigga that loves scuffles
And won't hesitate to sock you again for swollen knuckles
I'm like that, catch a nigga like bear traps
Blow his head back right in front of the precinct (YOU HEAR THAT!)
I slap your freak, bump you and won't speak
If you step on my feet, you get drowned in your own drink
I suffocated my shrink just for talking
Came back and fucked up his pallbearers and made them drop his coffin
It's fight music!

(Verse 5: Kuniva)
These beads I'm swinging is stinging them
See all these niggas? When I step in the club, I'm bringing them
If any nigga looking too hard, we Rodney King'n them
Malice green to them and gasolining them with premium
Light a cigarette, flick it at them or spit it at them
Hold up a picture of his family and kick it at him (no!)
Blast while you right hooking, right when your wife's looking
Fuck fight music, bitch, this is losing your life music!

(Verse 6: Eminem)
If I could capture the rage of today's youth and bottle it
Crush the glass from my bare hands and swallow it!
And spit it back in the faces of you racists
And hypocrites who think the same shit but don't say shit!
You Liberace's, Versace's, and you Nazis
Watch me, cause you figured you got me in this hot seat!
You motherfuckers wanna JUDGE me 'cause you're NOT me!
You'll never STOP me, I'm TOP speed as you POP me!
I came to save these new generations of babies!
From parents who failed to raise them 'cause they're lazy!
To grow to praise me I'm making them go crazy!
That's how I got this whole nation to embrace me!
And you fugazi if you think I'mma admit wrong!
I cripple any hypocritic critic I'm siced on!
And this song is for any kid who gets picked on!
A sick song to retaliate to, and it's called!

It's fight music!",aggressive, Fight Music,rlytqMUyyyk
